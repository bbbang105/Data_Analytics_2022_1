27-Aug-21,the United States,1,"~a month later, quest 2 is now just an annoying brick","I think Facebook did a great thing with this ""new"" release of the quest 2. The headset itself feels quite nice, although the strap is definitely something to work on, it's way too front heavy. It's also extremely uncomfortable using glasses, unfortunately. Even with that said, the Oculus link feature was the only reason I bought this headset; and it's everything I could of asked for. My internet isn't even that good, all it needed was my laptop to be connected by ethernet for a smooth, high quality PCVR experience that I could take ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE! I only had slight lags and stutters, but that's likely just my mediocre hardware. I'm a bit bummed by the comparably smaller control scheme compared to something like the vive.If you really want to have the best experience with this headset though, then don't put away that wallet just yet. At the very least, a new strap would be optimal, and I'd stay away from the first party elite strap. A new face cover might be good for you as well, as the default foam cover isn't the best for everyone.Overall, this headset is a great step in the right direction for vr tech. Although, out of the box, it should be subject to some modifications; which some could call a feature.One more thing, don't worry about the whole Facebook account thing. If you're fine with using whatsapp or Instagram, this shouldn't be a problem either. It's not like Facebook with Oculus is a new thing either, as Facebook has owned Oculus for 7 years now.Edit: after about a month of use, this headset has now become the most annoying piece of tech I own. The one feature I bought this for (Airlink) is straight garbage over half the time, im spending more time trying to fix this failure than I am actually using it. Connection hilariously unstable over ethernet with completely random performance drops. So both an unstable and sometimes unplayable experience that I paid 300 dollars for.","1,114",1
28-Aug-21,the United States,1,Has to be one of the worst experiences ever,The Quest 2 requires you to use your real name and photos via a Facebook account to use essentially a video game system.This is beyond ridiculous.I do not want to use Facebook.I tried to create a dummy Facebook account and it suspended my account making me upload pictures of my face.What the hell!!!I just want to play some games.Shame on Facebook.Shame on Oculus.Shame on the employees working there.Shame shame shame.I¡¯ll be returning this.This is why Facebook is a garbage company.,"1,063",1
29-Aug-21,the United States,5,64 more GEEBEES for 100 less MONEES,I mean what a good deal.,787,1
30-Aug-21,the United States,1,Good device hate having to have Facebook,Good device hate having to have Facebook.Airlink is nice.Just completely stupid that you have to have a Facebook to even use the device.You are losing customers by forcing them to use Facebook.,675,1
31-Aug-21,the United States,1,Facebook Ads - Cheap Product,"My expectations were probably a little too high to be able to just plug the thing into my computer and start playing. It led me through a very linear and invasive data gathering setup with no way to skip or ignore. Why would facebook do this? They're making most of their money on this product collecting your data by linking this product to everything it possibly can. You are paying for a way for facebook to gather your info and make money off of it. You don't like it? Return it like I did. I have a lot of great things to say about the return process. This is the first thing I've ever returned, and I gotta say that it was a great process.Facebook stuff aside, the screen door effect was very noticeable and distracting. I might be a bit spoiled from having a 4k monitor, but it was definitely a large step down from where I would be impressed. The strap it comes with is pretty bad. I couldn't get it on my head right. When I did finally get it in an ok place on my head with the eye spacers just right, there was a GIANT gap where the nose section should meet my face. Everything said and done, I couldn't return the thing fast enough. I owned it maybe 2 hours before I totally lost interest.",314,1
01-Sep-21,the United States,1,You HAVE to have a Facebook Acct.No thanks,I cancelled my order because I saw om youtube that I HAVE to get a facebook account? No way I don't want to have them spy on me thank you. Also I found out I will have to use my Iphone also. No way I do not use my phone to go on line to apps. Just text and phone. I did not see all this in the ad for this VR headset.Whoever thought of this (facebook) should be fired. Also I was told the lens has blurry issues.,295,1
02-Sep-21,the United States,5,"Fantastic, and no fuss.","Honestly, the best thing about this sort of VR is that there's no wires to deal with. Turn on, sign in with Facebook, and done.Also, Beat Saber is pretty much the greatest thing ever. Just...yeah... Beat Saber is life.I know there's something to be said for ohnoes!, - Facebook has more data! Honestly, if they want to see me flail around in Beat Saber, knock yourself out, Facebook.I did pick up the Elite headband/battery/case, and that finishes off the package, but it's by no means necessary - just nice to have. Overall, loving this thing. Yes, the resolution could still be (a lot) better, but for convenience and fun - this is where it's at. We've come a long way from the PSVR days and the crazy setup process and cabling.Excellent stuff, - and great value in its new 128GB configuration. 4.5 out of 5.",197,1
03-Sep-21,the United States,5,Simply a game changer with a great price point!,"This 128GB storage capacity is supposed to replace in full the previous 64GB version while keeping the same amazing price!I must admit this 128GB now suits most newer games which are usually massive in size. This is really an excellent space to store good/new/high quality games. Even giving the option to store/watch more 2D and 3D movies.I myself liked the head strap that comes with it, although I never tried the Elite Strap.I would also recommend getting an anti-scratch silicone ring protector if you wear a glass like me as this should help both: your glasses and the VR lenses from getting scratched. It will let you keep your glasses on while playing games or watching movies.Before you use the headset straight away, it needs a few tweaks here and there to ensure comfortable wear specifically for your head size and comfortable view for your eyes by adjusting both the strap sizing and placement as well as the IPD settings.A VR silicon cover is now included in the box which is a great addition for people with sensitive skin. This also resolves many of the complaints about skin irritation in the previous version.Being a classic PC gamer for many years, I would say VR technology is really something that every gamer should try. Just make sure that you are playing in a safe space and a specialized playing area!The Oculus Quest 2 is a fully standalone VR headset and I may also call it a ¡°gaming monster¡±, with native built-in games if you don¡¯t have a powerful gaming PC. It also works with steam VR games with no problem if you do have a gaming PC and you can connect them both using Steam link and the Oculus Link desktop app.The headset can have a refresh rate of up to 90Hz for some games, compared to only 72Hz on the previous model which also has a lower resolution. This is a big plus of course.Overall, in my opinion, this is the best VR headset around at this moment which can render up to near 4K resolution at 90hz.",172,1
04-Sep-21,the United States,5,This has the best enjoyment/dollar value of just about any purchase ever.,"This is my first and only VR experience.With that said, in just the first few minutes, during the setup and updating process, my mouth was agape.The tutorial had me smiling in wonder at the feeling of immersion.The apps available natively to the Quest 2 are varied and fun, if not cheap, but there are demos and free games out there.We like is so much, we are probably buying a second in the near future.However, my favorite piece of this requires use of a decent PC and fast Wi-Fi: Oculus AirLink, currently in Beta, is a cable free connection to the Oculus program on your computer that allows use of Oculus Rift and Steam VR games.These are generally games that need the extra processing power of a real GPU, and offer better graphics and more complex environments than the Quest alone can provide.Google Earth VR, a free app that isn't on the Quest natively is, for me, worth the price of admission on its own.Being able to walk among the skyscrapers of NYC, or play Gojira in Tokyo is awe inspiring.A couple of minor cons:Battery life is poor.During our first days, when we were using it especially heavily, I had a battery pack and USB-C cable connected to the Quest that we'd swap into pockets to add play time.They make improved head-strap setups that include provisions for holding a battery.About that strap, some in my family complained about it, so we may be shopping for an upgrade.I can live with it, however.In low light, the guardian, the virtual barrier that is set to keep you from running into walls, can flake out, dropping you out of the game.And lastly, a big con for some folks: This requires an active, real, Facebook account.Deactivating your account deactivates your Quest.Deleting you account deletes, permanently, all of your purchased apps, with no refund.There are lots of reports regarding problems with folks using fake names, secondary accounts, other folk's accounts, etc.When there are problems, Facebook will delete or lock accounts, and render your Quest a brick.Customer service is reportedly horrendous when trying to fix these problems.My advice would be to use your real account, don't fudge around, and you should be fine.Yes, they are tracking you, Yes they are subsidizing the prices of these thing by commodifying your data.However, unless you are already complete social media hermit, getting in bed a little deeper isn't going to alter your data footprint in any significant way.If you are here shopping on Amazon with a cellphone in your hand or pocket, worrying about Facebook is sort of pointless.TL;DR - GET ONE.It's a great value within the reach of many people.You can have a ton of fun without a PC, and even more with one.",133,1
23-Sep-21,the United States,1,These Developers Don't Understand Consumers,"OK So I gave it one star for the fact that VR is cool.It won't get 5 stars nor will I buy another headset from facebook's oculus for the following:-applications are SLOW and freeze all the time no matter how few apps you have open.-Multitasking is limited. Most apps put you all in on their app. There is no desktop and no windows.-Remote desktop is virtual and very slow.-Graphics are not that great. Things close up are fuzzy and pixilated at 1080. VRis not ready yet.-The keyboards in VR are interrupted by your pointer finger acting like a mouse randomly clicking things when you type.-The headset sucks at mapping my environment. Change one thing and suddenly I have to remap my environment instead of gaming. When you try to remap it... it remembers you placed a guardian or barrier then stops the setup. Then it forgets and makes you do setup. This keeps looping until you are pissed and restart the system.-There is no place to plug in headphones. Everyone has to listen to your music.-I constantly have to go to windows settings because the apps take over my computer speaker... oddly enough the device cannot usb-c connect or air connect but it can VR desktop and turn off my sound even when I turn off the headset.-The headset randomly glitches the environment making you seasick outside of apps-They are like apple trying to restrict all apps or on the Facebook system only. However, then all your friends with other devices are playing games outside of oculus closed system. They need to have a desktop home screen with windows not this browser internet only nonsense. I will not buy another one of these. There is too much to fix! They ruined VR for me. Especially as someone who develops games in UE4",84,1
24-Sep-21,the United States,5,Such a crazy experience,"Got mine delivered really fast. I was able to set up everything with no problem and with ease. Truly a crazy experience to be in a virtual world--you actually forget that what you see isn't actually real. I found myself oftentimes carefully not bumping into the i.e. furniture in the virtual world when it was just space and nothingness outside of it. One of the coolest features I am stumped about is that if you leave a certain area that you have previously marked, the headset has a grayscale camera that reveals what's in front of you. This is extremely useful for safety measures as it alerts you if you stray too far from your marked territory. Absolutely love it! Also, the headset lasts for about ~2 hours before you need to recharge if you're playing games nonstop.Edit: For those who wear glasses, I highly recommend to buy VR Wave prescription lenses with the headset. For me personally, it's been huge inconvenience trying to remove the headset and putting it back on until I made the investment and bought the lenses. It'll definitely help with having fun in VR without having to adjust your headset frequently.",462,2
25-Sep-21,the United States,2,Updated review: User Experience Testing? Don't think so.,"VR has finally started coming of age.I am very much enjoying this device but I'm also very annoyed at having to have a Facebook account.I'm also not very fond of the way the device daisy-chains to connect to Steam, and I've had problems across the two VR systems.There is a learning curve here for sure.That said, this is a whole lot of fun.UPDATE:lots of usage later I have discovered that this device is perfect for running a real-life emulation of what gaming was like in the early 90s.Conflicts and drivers and incompatibilities and half-ready features and buggy, homebuilt games.Oh my.I am not sure what the timeplayed to timefixing ratio might be with this thing, but I have to admit that my 'fun' threshold has been crossed.Here are some of the things you will learn about when you get one of these, to save you some time on Google:Oculus native vr, Oculus Link VR, Steam VR (always crashes eventually), Sidequest, Oculus developer account, VorpX, Virtual Desktop, games that support 90hz and games that do not, trying to reclaim your Steam titles from the Oculus, accidentally buying the native, link, AND steam versions of an app.The list goes on and on.Also, to me, anything that makes me take the headset off and go back to my pc is a strike against.Oculus link will fail at least 30% of the time.Also, if you want to attempt a wireless connection to the device you have to have a very specific network setup for it to even almost work.You must have your PC connected to the router by CABLE so that the only wireless connection is from the mask to the router.*** I accomplished this by hanging an extra access point from my Ethernet connection, bridged to my WiFi.Connecting directly to the private AP worked better in Link, almost perfectly in Virtual Desktop, but, Sidequest stopped working because you can't change the IP in there-- anyway, nothing is easy on this thing.I'm going to file this under ""really cool and almost works novelty"" and go back to gaming on my 3080/240hz modern setup.I'll strap the two ancient low-resolution, low-performance monitors to my face with the snorkling mask as an experiment but I've given up on any notion of actually playing any of these titles.Most of the time you end up taking your mask on and off to troubleshoot things and never progress in the games, unless you like jaggies and blurriness, freezes and skipped frames.Also, if you plan on getting the most out of this VR thing you need to have a VERY large, empty space to play in- you can choose to play seated and stationary in some games, but you still may end up knocking stuff off of your desk.Be careful.Which brings me to the METAVERSE.OK, I understand what Zuck is going for.Here are some problems that will put that idea in the ground:* Headaches and nausea for everyone thanks to the low quality graphics, if you wear glasses you will have problems.*ALL of the ""meta"" apps are creepy and featureless works in progress.I've never had any desire to either float around as a noseless cartoon head with three fingered hands or play a hyper-realistic sex robot.*The user community is, by definition, very very young and very very spoiled.This is a rich kid's toy (or a toy for a retiree with too much time on his hands.)It takes a beefy computer to make this work.Not cheap. *Mandatory Facebook integration: I don't expect this to last. (BTW, anyone who thinks that Zuck didn't know that ""Meta"" means ""Death"" really needs some critical-thinking skill training.)There is something creepy going on here.So the ""metaverse"" will be populated solely by people with money and time and huge empty play spaces who enjoy playing ping-pong with strangers on the death network.This is not an idea destined for popular acceptance.Don't invest in it.This is not ready for prime time yet, and it appears that Facebook is intent on developing the technology solely to enslave people with it.This thing COULD be fun, but it ain't there yet.",104,2
26-Sep-21,the United States,1,REQUIRES a Facebook account / login,"This REQUIRES a Facebook account to use, which is not possible (or wise!) for kids.My 10 yr old kid really wants a VR headset, but after ordering I found out that comes at the cost of a Facebook account, so forget it!It¡¯s going back..",65,2
27-Sep-21,the United States,5,New world for me,"The media could not be loaded.<U+00A0>This is the best gaming experience for years, also I'm sweating a lot, so divesting in oculus is like investing in gym subscription",66,2
28-Sep-21,the United States,1,"Buggy, laggy, painful to use, not really ready for public use","Having owned an HTC Vive for several years, I was interested in trying out what is supposedly the ""next generation"" of VR headsets.I especially liked the idea that it was smaller and more portable and did not need extra boundary sensors and things.But right off the bat, the system was annoying and user un-friendly.For starters, you can't fully-install or run the softwareunless you give GPS location information to Facebook.This is completely unnecessary.Facebook does not need to know my GPS location in order to enable me to pair the device with my mobile phone (that was another unknown requirement: you have to install a special app on your phone to continue configuration of the device. Hardly plug-and-play, and if you don't give Occulus permission to know your location, it will give you ambiguous messages indicating something is wrong when they know exactly what's wrong: they won't allow you to complete the installation unless you give them unnecessary personal information.That's inappropriate.)The Rift has some neat features like a convenient boundary and object detection system, but its processing is just too slow to make VR enjoyable.Even rudimentary games just do not play well.Ok, fine, after all that mess I fire the system up and it immediately wants to up-sell me on a bunch of extra software that I already have purchased on Steam.The system is SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than other VR headsets years older.Playing common games like Rec Room or Pokerstars VR result in laggy, unplayable gameplay.It's really horrible.I'm very disappointed in this product.Will not be purchasing any more Occulus products.",62,2
29-Sep-21,the United States,1,Really cool if your a facebook tool,I bought this before I knew you had to have a facebook account to log in. I made a fake account. They already banned it in thirty minutes. If it turns into a whole thing. Ill be returning all this. Its not worth giving my entire life to meta to sell peicemeal. Id rather fork over the extra money for htc or valve,60,2
30-Sep-21,the United States,5,"Breathtaking, easy to use and set up",The media could not be loaded.<U+00A0>I expected this to be good but not this amazing!! The app Wander has taken me to beautiful places I wish I could visit. You feel as if you are just flying.Watch the movie ¡°We are stars¡± 360vr on YouTube and it will take your breath away! My grandson came over and played a drum game¡¦ he asked to have this for Christmas after he played it lol (he is 5) and grandma will oblige of course (with parents supervisor and consent).You need to get this and share it with friends. There will be no way back. At least for someone like me who is not a gamer.,76,2
01-Oct-21,the United States,1,"Lousy interface, low resolution","The unboxing was a nightmare. Couldn't find the usb port. It was covered by protective paper. I thought the power button was a covered usb port and tried to remove it. I tried to piNiall fx starwars gameand ended up standing in the table. I'm not going to waste 2 days to figure it out. I even tried to watch a movie, it was at 720p. And I had motion sickness. If I could afford another headset it would be a Vive that uses Displayport.",93,2
02-Oct-21,the United States,1,Facebook Account Required,"One of my buddies got this VR set and he really enjoys it.I decided to get one as well, but I missed the requirement that you needed a Facebook account.To be clear, I missed it because there was no information showing this requirement.I saw things like:Buy an Oculus Quest 2 by Nov. 29, 2021 and receive $50 digital credit towards future Amazon.com purchasesNext-level Hardware - Make every move count with a blazing-fast processor and our highest-resolution displayAll-In-One Gaming - With backward compatibility, you can explore new titles and old favorites in the expansive Quest content libraryImmersive Entertainment - Get the best seat in the house to live concerts, groundbreaking films, exclusive events and moreEasy Setup - Just open the box, set up with the smartphone app and jump into VR. No PC or console needed. Requires wireless internet access and the Oculus app (free download) to set up devicePremium Display - Catch every detail with a stunning display that features 50% more pixels than the original QuestUltimate Control - Redesigned Oculus Touch controllers transport your movements directly into VR with intuitive controlsPC VR Compatible - Step into incredible Oculus Rift titles by connecting an Oculus Link cable to a compatible gaming PC. Oculus Link Cable sold separately3D Cinematic Sound - Hear in all directions with built-in speakers that deliver cinematic 3D positional audioNo information at all about the need for a FB account.Since I don't have a FB account and will not create one I am going to have to return this device.",57,2
03-Oct-21,the United States,1,A Disappointingly Low Quality VR Experience,"I was more than excited to get the new Oculus Quest 2 based on all of the stellar reviews. But I was extremely disappointed with the low quality of the display for a product that's priced this high.It's extremely blurry and not even remotely clear unless you're staring directly at a single spot on the screen. If you even look a little bit left or right then it becomes even more distorted. You're watching videos recorded in 8K that have the look of a 360p equivalent based on what you're actually seeing in front of your eyes.It's clear that the technology has not caught up yet in order to provide a decent VR experience. I feel that they're rushing to sell these standalone units that aren't tethered to PCs, because most people don't have higher end PCs anymore. At least not anywhere close to what you'd need to run it at a decent enough refresh rate or resolution. It's just not powerful enough to run without some decent hardware, which probably run several grand. I feel it's basically like having a smartphone with goggles attached to it.The advances in the actual interaction in the VR world are quite incredible. The controllers and interface are very impressive, which allow you to interact with objects even with your bare hands. However, it's all a moot point if the display quality makes the experience unusable in the first place.I had high hopes of having a better experience based on the reviews that you see everywhere online and on YouTube. It fell far short of my expectations, yet everywhere you look reviewers and companies are raving about it. But I guess if you have a multi-billion dollar company that controls social media, then you're bound to have biased ""opinions"" work out in your favor.Do yourself a major favor and try out someone else's before making the purchase. If you're anything like me, then you just might be completely underwhelmed with this newest VR experience by Oculus.",48,2
04-Oct-21,the United States,5,amazing experience,very good quality headset.Feels very comfortable to wear if you put back strap near your ocipital bone but sadly lot of people don't know how to wear properly i mentioned.Great for watch netflixmovie in monster IMAX theater screen and also tons of 3D VR 180 videos on Youtube.Games are so many to choose and more new gameto come every week.,86,3
23-Oct-21,the United States,1,My 12 year old has become a cynic,"The kiddo saved up FOREVER to buy these VR goggles. It was all he could talk about and drove us crazy. He finally had enough, ordered them with expedited shipping, and planted by the door the day they were scheduled to arrive. Exactly 2 days after he got them, he said they kept going to a gray screen, showing some dots, then wouldn't power on until he did a hard restart. We Googled the headset to see if we could resolve the issue. This is a KNOWN problem dating back to their original release and no corrections have been made. Literally thousands of blogs, reviews, and forums address this. I don't blame the seller because they were awesome and very responsive to our refund request after two weeks of trying to figure out a solution. Do your research. Some are just fine with no problems, and then there are those that make a 12 year old question how a manufacturer can continue to sell an item with known issues. The whole ordeal really sucked the wind out of his sails.",36,3
24-Oct-21,the United States,1,You have to have a Facebook account. I don't believe in Facebook.,"Unless you want to turn your whole piece of mind over to Facebook, do not buy. Requires a Facebook account before you can even use it. So in other words you buy it. Facebook owns it.",49,3
25-Oct-21,the United States,3,"Not great, not terrible","Oculus Quest 2 is really great if your intention is just to play Beat Saber all day. But the reality is that practically speaking, it's a lower resolution and lower tier VR experience. Facebook's own Horizon Workspaces doesn't work very well on the Quest 2, because it has low resolution and trying to focus your eyes on your computer screen in VR Is not very fun. Immersed (another VR workspace app) is okay, and low enough latency for decent work in VR but the resolution of the Quest 2 will still bite you.Apps like YouTube VR are okay, because the screen is practically at the optimized FOV convergence point. But the reality is that the display is so low resolution that 360 videos kinda don't look great on the display anyway. It's really a shame.A different head strap is mandatory. This hurts a TON after wearing it for any extended period of time. Impressively bad head strap. Will leave red marks on your face.Finally, the biggest thing I haven't mentioned is that the device itself runs Android, and it's a pretty low powered android device. Unfortunately, this means that apps like YouTube VR can lag and stutter, which really sucks more in VR than any other device. In VR, lag and stuttering means that your view suddenly freezes, which immediately creates motion sickness. Not great.But it's an okay first experience for VR. It's a great Beat Saber machine. For anything other than Beat Saber, you're probably better off waiting for the Quest 3 or getting a different VR headset with higher resolution displays and better FOV lenses.",55,3
26-Oct-21,the United States,5,Love Supernatural app! Best purchase all year!,"I specifically bought the Quest 2 to try out Supernatural, absolutely the best purchase all year!I'm a 50 something morbidly obese woman who struggles with mobility issues so I use my Quest 2 while seated in a swiveling office chair (I recommend no arms...) Yes Beat Saber is fun and Wander allows me to explore the globe from home but Supernatural is LIFE CHANGING.Just in 2 months of using the Supernatural app to workout (flow and now BOXING!) I am seeing many physical improvements! My body is toning up, I'm developing obvious new muscles in my arms, back, neck, belly and LEGS - all while seated from a chair! I'm walking easier, my legs and back hurt less and I have more energy. I'm stunned my calves and thighs are getting stronger, my husband pointed out he sees me using my legs to pivot the chair to follow portals and I do lean n lunge with thetriangles, too.The Supernatural FB community is awesome too. I've met some really cool new online friends from around the country.I highly recommend the Q2 though unless you plan to download a ton of movies you really only need the 128 version. 2 months in and I realize there's no way I will fill the 256 unless I record many hours of my Supernatural workouts lolGet the Quest 2, Get Supernatural and JOIN US! You'll be glad you did!",34,3
27-Oct-21,the United States,5,This thing is amazing,"This is the virtual reality device I have been dreaming of since the mid 90s. I am primarily a PC gamer, so I wanted something that would work with my PC, and I was not all that interested in the standalone functionality. I was amazed at the quality of the standalone quest 2 games. The virtual environments are much more convincing than I expected. It really feels like you are IN these games. The controllers do a great job of mimicking real life hand use, and the haptic feedback can make it feel like you are actually touching/pressing things (example:saving your game in Resident Evil 4 VR really feels like you are typing on an old mechanical typewriter). The first time I took the headset off, I had to spend several seconds processing the fact that my living room was indeed real. You can also use this to watch shows and movies, and even meet up with people this way. I delayed buying one for years because I was worried I would regret it, but instead it's better than I dared to hope.",61,3
28-Oct-21,the United States,5,I am absolutely blown away!,"I have always loved the idea of VR and I have tried it a handful of times through store kiosks and local arcades that have them. But I was never able to actually own one myself because I never had a PC powerful enough nor the room space to be able to use it effectively. But I recently got a new apartment that is huge and I finally scrapped the extra money together to buy the quest 2 and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I love that it does not require any cables to be able to use it when it is charged so the freedom inside the games feels even more immersive. I also love the picture quality, I was nervous at first seeing as how it is not using a PC to be it's graphical power source but I was wrong, it is gorgeous and I literally feel like I am in another world. I will also say for anyone concerned (I didn't give a crap at all btw), it was just announced yesterday that a Facebook account is no longer required to use this device, so if that was a deal breaker for you then you're in luck! So far I have played Superhot, VR-Chat, Arizona Sunshine, and Vader Immortal and they were all breathtaking experiences and I was in my glory the entire time. The controllers are super accurate and feel great to hold, every button is perfectly positioned on the controllers. I also found that the 128gb model is plenty of storage for how small most of the games are install size wise so I feel there is no need to spend an extra $100 on unneeded storage. One thing that may be an issue for some is the head-strap built onto the headset itself. I had heard from a few people that the (sold separately) strap extension is a MUST for people with even remotely bigger heads, I find as someone with a big head that the default head-strap is completely fine for me. Luckily I opted to take a risk and not buy the separate strap extension because it would have been a waste of money for me. You may want it if you wear glasses though which I do not. But, obviously no device is perfect so I will say what I do not like is how short the battery life is but I suppose it is a good thing because it forces you to give your eyes a break so it is what it is. All and all, I would highly recommend this device to everyone. It is amazing.",39,3
29-Oct-21,the United States,1,Blurry!!!,How can you sell such a blurry piece of hardware? We tried adjusting the lens in the 3 different positions. Tried by all members of the family including a kid. Everyone finds it the content BLURRY!!! Feels like watching a poor quality SD video. Was this not tested before releasing??,31,3
30-Oct-21,the United States,1,A user should not have to create a Facebook account to use,"I purchased this product because I thought using some of the exercise games would be a good way of getting myself off of the couch. My first disappointment was learning that I had to create a Facebook account in order to use this device.I don't use Facebook because they've been so lax with their users personal data.And, given all of the media attention they've gotten regarding how their own research shows how harmful one of its platforms is to young girls, that they held onto, gives me no faith that they want to protect us or our data.I decided that I would create an account and only use it when I use the Oculus.This is where my second disappointment came about. I went through the process of creating an account and once I was done I got a message stating that my account did not meet community standards. What?!! I was asked to upload a picture of myself so that they could verify I'm really who I said I was, which I did (are they using facial recognition?).I got this final message, ""We received your informationIf we still find that your account didn't follow our Community Standards, it will remain disabled.We're always looking out for the security of people on Facebook, so until then you can't use your account"".I doubt they're looking out for my security or yours.If my account is still disabled after a couple of days I'll send the $399 device back and get my exercise the old fashion way.Until then, the Oculus is nothing more than a lead weight.",27,3
31-Oct-21,the United States,1,Facebook account,"Can't say if the product was any good, as once I got it, I discovered (as part of the install process) that you absolutely HAD to have a Facebook account to even install the headset, and, link it to your Facebook account!Spent some time chatting with their helpdesk who said there was NO way around that...so returned the item.I refuse to make a FBaccount just to use a headset, and certainly don't need Facebook targeting me with ads based on what I play on it.",26,3

02-Nov-21,the United States,3,"No ipd setting higher then 70, cheap silicon cover",My ipd is 72 so I can only use it for less then a hour because I start getting a headache. I also wear glasses and they don't fit inside the headset. You can get some lens adapters from vrwave but their half the price of the quest 2. Overall if your ipd is above 70 I wouldn't bother buying.,54,4
03-Nov-21,the United States,5,Awesome !,"Bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and I was too excited to wait so he opened it and absolutely loved it ! Set up took about 10min and it comes with plenty free apps to try it out but I¡¯m sure we¡¯ll buy a few games soon. Didn¡¯t have any issues with the lenses, they had 3 modes and the 2nd mode worked the best. Very comfy headset and very easy to use. Worth it 100% !!!",38,4
04-Nov-21,the United States,1,"Controlled limited market, avoid this product","The product is digitally locked down and limits the uses.Can be used for 3d movies and resolution is good, but everything you do is tracked and linked to your account.Wish I had not purchased.",24,4
05-Nov-21,the United States,1,"Interesting. But, Not That Special. And, You're forced to Get FaceBook. NO way around That","Causes eye strain. No amount of adjusting makes this feel comfortable. I purchased the Elite head strap. It's like having a brick tied to your face. It's like inviting people over to a party, but then you hide in the bathroom, and you can then go 'ah and ooh' and tell them how cool it is. And, they wait for you to come out eventually. When you pull it off your face, you're slimy and gross. Yey, motions sickness, that what I wanted.My curiosity was satisfied after one demo. Packed it up and sent it back. Did I mention YOU MUST GET FACEBOOK? There's no workaround. You must have or create a Facebook account.",23,4
06-Nov-21,the United States,5,Great virtual reality helmet,"I took this helmet as my first. I really liked himOf the merits, very good picture quality (no pixels visible)Games can be run directly on the helmet itself, it's just like a console on your head! Moreover, the games look pretty nice, although some games look better on pcExcellent tracking of controllers I have never had such a thing that he lost controllersHand tracking is also present, but it works mediocre enough. It needs excellent lighting and does not cover each other's hands. In general, a cool feature, but for now it needs some work.Well, it's also worth noting that the headset itself has an excellent sound! I thought that he would be pretty mediocre on it, and therefore decided to take headphones as well. Headphones are certainly not bad, but I still prefer the sound from the helmet itself so as not to wear anything extraI also want to note the controllers themselves, the batteries that are preinstalled at the bottom can last a charge for about a month, and also from time to time I can hit the wall and the controllers are quite strong (unlike my fingers)Well, the price is $ 300Of the minuses Once, I accidentally hit the helmet with the controller and the sound in one of the headphones on the helmet disappeared, but then I accidentally hit it again and it came back <U+00AF> \ _ («Ä) _ / <U+00AF>",42,4

09-Nov-21,the United States,3,Review from an Original Quest User,"I originally ordered the 64gb but was cancelled due to the transition to 128gb. The storage obviously wasn¡¯t the reason that I wanted to ¡°upgrade¡± to the Quest 2, it was really for the supposedly lighter weight.I was disappointed to find out that the weight for both Quest and Quest 2 units are the same. The published weights for both headsets are with their respective straps attached. Of course, the unit with the cloth strap would come out lighter. I discovered this by having both attached to a Beswin Halo strap and both units came in at 731 grams to my surprise. All the YT reviews didn¡¯t bother to check I guess.If it wasn¡¯t for the higher storage, I would have returned this. The higher resolution, and better processor eases the disappointment as well. I would have been ok using the original for a bit longer but might as well enjoy the newest version, even if it is the same weight. The halo strap helps with that a bunch.",42,4
10-Nov-21,the United States,1,Facebook kills it.Had to return it.,"I really wanted to use this.I had a Facebook account years ago and didn't like it, so I deactivated it.My choice.Now, I could only go under that account, which it said was now disabled.I can't create a new one.Every avenue they gave to try to fix it did not work.It's impossible to actually talk to someone there.So I can't use this and have to return it.Why in the world you need to link it to a social platform, I have no idea.Especially when that platform has such poor customer support.Guess I'll just have to wait to see what the next Sony VR upgrade will be.",17,4
21-Nov-21,the United States,5,This is the Absolute Best thing I have ever purchased for myself.,"I bought this for video games, I have since been blown away by what I have found to be freely available.I have tried around 150 apps/games/experiences. I have only paid for about 8 of them. I learned how to make music tracks in Virtuoso, I took a tour of Ann Frank's house, I learned how it felt to lose your eye sight and experience your surroundings through sound, I have seen countless documentaries (which is a whole new experience since you are there in the world), I got to fly through the International Space Station, I have fought as a gladiator against man and beast, I have fired up my last shot against hordes of zombies before resorting to baseball bats as the adrenaline sores, I have spent many hours exercising in a variety of games, but one of my favorite is Moon Rider (a free VR web browser title)(it's a rhythm game that can be played with light sabers or by punching the beats), and I have also attended concerts and enjoyed events while still being able to be my normal introverted self.My computer is not at all capable of working with VR, so that sucks, but the amount of stuff the Quest 2 can do stand alone is insanely impressive!There is so much here, it is like buying yourself a second life. I highly recommend reading up ahead of time on a site such as UploadVr. They have great introductory stories hidden away on that site specifically to prepare you and educate you on the Quest 2.My 65 year old mother even bought one, primarily for indoor exercise, but she also enjoys the travel apps which is as close to going somewhere as you can get without going there. Personally I enjoy the free Virtual Traveller, but I think my mother uses a pay app.If you are on the fence about this, stop right now and just buy it.The only caveat to this is that you do need enough well lit space that you can swing your arms about in a circle.I very quickly made more and more and more room in my living room. Now with the holidays I new there would be trouble. I punched a Christmas ball off the tree yesterday whole in a demo fight in an amazing boxing game called The Fight. I still haven't found that ball. It was a good solid left hook! I've also punched the ceiling while jumping and grabbing for a frisbee in the free zero g space sports game that plays like a cross between Ender's Game and Tron. In the gladiator game Gladius I ended up punching the handle off my decorative display cabinet. I cut my hand up on that one. The point here is you need space. Even when you try not to move, you move! There is a digital barrier that you start to see if you get too close to the edge, but in the heat of the moment it's not always enough.",16,5
22-Nov-21,the United States,1,Never received my 50$ credit,"I never received my ""oculus50"" 50$ free credit.I like the Oculus, it's great.I liked it so much I bought my girlfriend one, only I bought hers from somewhere else because they jipped me on my 50$. Last post was deleted so I won't name the place, but this place gave me my 50$ credit right on the spot.Amazon says you get it within 24 hours after it ships but literally says within 36 days in the tos. Ridiculous transparency, and false advertising.Still got it in 2 days & it's a great device. Would've gotten 5 stars had they gave me the 50$, I planned on putting it towards Christmas anyways but it's all good.",16,5
23-Nov-21,the United States,5,I'm Going To Go Ahead And Say 'Amazing'!,"I'm very impressed with this headset! I wrestled with whether to pay $100 more for double the storage capacity, but after perusing apps in the Oculus store and averaging app sizes, I determined there was too little value in that. Down the road, if I get REALLY into VR in general, I might wind up regretting that decision, but I honestly think that would be the only thing I'd regret about this device.Oculus was experiencing some kind of server issue that prevented me from completing registration and setup right away, so it was about 4 hours after I unboxed it that I was able to use it. And boy, was I blown away! I still have a VR headset that requires a phone be stuck in it, but I haven't used it in a while for just that reason. This one, of course, doesn't need that, and the resolution is really, really good. Your IPD (Inter-pupillary distance), or the distance between your eyes, can be accommodated by selecting from 3 different widths. I read one review that said the maximum is 68mm, but their IPD was 72. In that case, the image will appear blurry. For that reason, I suggest checking your IPD before you purchase.What's in the box is simple, the headset, two controllers (with batteries), a spacer for those who wear glasses and a silicone piece that makes it comfortable to wear against your face. It's very well balanced and doesn't feel heavy to me, but there are optional head straps you can get if you find it too front-heavy. I also like the passthrough feature that lets you see your real-world environment if/when you need to.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and immersiveness of the sound, but I will probably get some ear buds soon so I can get a fuller volume level (I usually have the volume on about 6-7). But it sounds great. The 'Home' environment, which is set up like a house or apartment, is really cool, and there are several different designs available.I found the battery life, stated as about two hours, to be pretty accurate, but I bought a 10-foot USB cable so that I could have it plugged in and playing while it's charging (yes, you can use it fully while it's charging). There is a head strap available with a place for an optional battery to extend use time without worrying about a cable, but that doesn't seem necessary to me, at least not at this point. I just got done using it, and I was in VR for about 3 1/2 hours, and battery life was still 82%. So far, I have used it for probably 20 hours total since I've had it, and the controller batteries are still at 100%. I'm sure that depends on what you're doing, though.I have watched a couple of movies, and with the ability to have a curved screen (or flat if you prefer) that views even larger than my 60"" TV, it's just amazing. I've also played a few games, watched some videos of dancers, concerts, and awesome, immersive tours of places like Switzerland, Italy, the Matterhorn, Great Lakes, under-sea stuff and so many more. All of it has been awesome. And so far, I have found enough good, free content that I haven't gotten around to purchasing anything yet!Another effective feature is the voice control. You can do almost anything using voice commands, including powering the device off. I haven't explored that feature too deeply yet, but I have started and stopped apps and games, checked local time and weather and performed several other functions just by telling it what I want. You just double-press the 'Oculus' button to get it to listen for voice commandsOne complaint I know many will have, is that setting up the device REQUIRES a Facebook account. BUT, you can set it so that your FB profile info, including your profile name, will not be revealed in VR if you happen to do some multi-person thing, and neither is your Oculus username revealed to your FB contacts, so that doesn't bother me at all. The only thing I wish, and this is so minor it's really almost petty, but I do wish it came in black. That isn't even worth deducting stars over. Overall, I just love it, and I highly recommend it!",17,5
24-Nov-21,the United States,1,Isn't worth it,"I was not impressed with the quality of VR apps and games available right now.Perhaps in the future VR will be improved to the point where it lives up to the hype.The roller coaster and spacewalk apps were really good, but after that, I couldn't find any other apps or games that were impressive enough to justify the cost of the headset and accessories.The accessories are another thing.In order to use it, I needed to buy special headphones made especially for Oculus, a head strap that actually worked, an aftermarket face mask to keep out the light, and custom lenses as it is next to impossible to use it with eyeglasses.The $300.00 toy quickly became a $500.00 mistake.Thanks to Amazon's exceptional return policy I was able to send it all back for free with my Prime benefits.From what I experienced I think it will be a few more years before VR is truly ready for mainstream use.",12,5
25-Nov-21,the United States,5,Incredible set!!!,"The media could not be loaded.<U+00A0>I absolutely love this set! Came super fast. Packaged very well. No missing items¡¦.

26-Nov-21,the United States,1,Controller not working less than a week after purchasing.,"I purchased 2 Oculus Quest 2¡¯s for my boys for Christmas. It is an incredibly cool gift & the boys enjoy them more than any other gaming system they¡¯ve had, however, less than a week later one of the remotes has stopped working properly. Most of the time when you push the joystick forward to move forward you don¡¯t move at all. It¡¯s like there¡¯s a short in the joystick. This renders the Quest 2 useless & it¡¯s disappointing & frustrating for the main Christmas gift to stop working in less than a week.

27-Nov-21,the United States,1,Facebook ruins it,"When I try to create an oculus account it requires you to log into Facebook or create a Facebook account.When I log into my Facebook login through the oculus quest app it just spin and spins and never loads to lets you pair. So we tried my Wife's Facebook account on her iPhone since it didn't work on my Samsung.Same thing its just stuck on loading.Then I go to the oculus website and try to create an account with a new Facebook account that I just created.Same thing just loads loads loads.2 different phones 2 different browsers on my pc.clear history per support still no go.I would advise staying away from this VR that requires you to sign into or create a Facebook account just to use it when you can't even set it up.Horrible experience having to jump through Facebook hoops just to get the VR experience.Just wait for more reliable VR from Play station, Xbox, Gaming on PC's.Facebook is the worst.",14,5
28-Nov-21,the United States,4,Wow... the material is BAD.,"I understand why they added the new face covers. The material is BAAAAD. Don't get me wrong, it's a great headset. Stronger than the Quest 1, cheaper and lighter. HOWEVER, the build quality is not as great as the Quest 1. They're kind of going the Quantity over Quality route.I've owned the Quest 1, HP Reverb G2, and Valve Index. Unfortunately, I had to downscale so I sold my index and got a Quest 2. This is how I look at it.First off, the face cover... it feels like cheap memory foam they pulled out of a car's seats. Within 5 seconds, my face felt like it did on the Quest 1 in an hour long gaming session. The new covers fix that, but man, I never thought I'd miss the old cover so much. The old ones honestly felt decent. Not too premium, not too rough. It honestly felt like I was rubbing a fine sponge on my face, first time using this thing.The controllers also look worse. They feel the same as the older ones, but they look like they were put together in a rush. On the older controllers, there were barely any noticeable gaps in the plastic, but they are SO obvious here. EDIT : New note; Tracking somehow seems worse... I'd say 3/4 times I use the headset, my Tracking is lost while I'm playing in a pretty well lit and detailed room. The Tracking of the controllers also seems worse. Functionally, it is the same. But Tracking on the Quest 1 definitely felt much smoother.The head strap is part downgrade/part neutral. I find it good that you can upgrade them, but we're talking about the base straps. The Quest 2 straps pinch your hair, if you've just recently cut them and they also chew on your ears. Of this whole experience I've had with the Quest 2, it's been my ears that have been the most annoyed. Audio is also lopsides, with my left hearing more than right. I'm gonna assume this can be resolved with some kind of RMA, but I'm fine with this.The software somehow also feels like a downgrade (or over complication and under complication). In the older versions (Quest 1 versions), you could find most things on one tab and basic functions were in submenus. Everything is all over the place now, and settings is placed in the library like an app... that's just weird. Also, the controllers... they represent where your fingers are a lot less than the older ones. It's a small detail, but it got me so immersed in the Quest 1. It doesn't sit well with me, but it's a minor problem.Lastly, IPD adjustment... I guess it's not that big of a deal, but I'd have preferred a 'by the millimeter' system. It does its job though.As for pros of this headset, there's a lot...1. It's a cheap entry into VR and you won't even need a PC.2. Oculus Software is usually pretty clean (I don't like how it changed so much, but I'll get used to it.)3. You can play PCVR with it.4. It generally improved on its predecessor, and at a lower cost.5. You can upgrade comfort.Would I recommend it? If you're willing to ignore facebook being a requirement, yeah. It's still a versatile headset, regardless of it's downsides.",9,5
29-Nov-21,the United States,1,Don¡¯t buy,The headset is linked to your Facebook account doesn¡¯t sound so bad until you have a problem with your Facebook account mine was disabled for a post from 2014 it didn¡¯t even show me the post now my head can¡¯t be used because it¡¯s tied to that account I¡¯m on day 42 with 37 emails and still can¡¯t use the headset,17,5
30-Nov-21,the United States,1,An absolute regret,"Most of my games on the Oculus store that worked fine with the rift, now crash when either loading a level or just starting the game.No issues with my games on steam as far as I can tellThe inverse might make sense but... Pretty pathetic a 3rd party can run their hardware properly and FB can't.",18,5
