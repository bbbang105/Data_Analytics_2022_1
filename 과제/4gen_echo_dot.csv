05-Nov-20,the United States,4,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for Echo Dot 4th Gen (HR)."," Pros:__________<U+2022> The globe design with the fabric speaker layout is a decent upgrade from all the previous flat Echos. With the glowing ring now at the bottom of the device, you get a mini space ship.<U+2022> The ¡°tap to snooze¡± is a feature that will be helpful if anyone wants this Echo near their bed. When the alarm rings you just need to tap the speaker (the device) with two or more fingers and it will go to snooze for a short time. No button pressing, just anywhere on the speaker and it¡¯ll let you sleep a little more (but just a little more).<U+2022> A 3.5mm audio jack for connecting a wired speaker. This is something that Google¡¯s nest mini no longer has. I appreciated that Amazon put this in.<U+2022> If you never used amazon products before, the setup process on any of their machines are ridiculously easy. This is no exception. Just a phone, an app and that¡¯s it.<U+2022> I¡¯ve had their previous model and setting this up was even easier because all the info I had on my account (Wi-Fi password, smart-plugins, etc.) just merge in flawlessly with this Echo.<U+2022> Alexa itself is fast. From weather to set times, to stories, and even jokes. If I want directions she responds almost instantly and overall performs excellent, like the previous model.<U+2022> One of the perks of Amazon Echos is the vast inventory of smart devices that you can connect with. You can buy smart plugins, smart lights, and 1000s more to make your place a ¡°smart¡± place. In this day in age, the restrictions on what a smart device can be are minimal, and overall it¡¯s a big reason why you want to buy an Echo instead of Apple¡¯s Homepod.<U+2022> You¡¯re able to listen in on another room if you¡¯re not in the area and the Echo is. A pretty neat tool to have if you¡¯re in an ¡°uncertain¡± relationship.<U+2022> The Echo does an excellent job of understanding your routines. For example, my hallway, and bedroom lights are always on at the same time before bed. If I¡¯m in bed I can say ¡°Alexa, good night¡± and Alexa will shut both of them off. This can also be used to say ¡°Alexa, good morning¡± and Alexa can turn on any smart devices at the same time in the morning. TV, stereo, coffee maker, all you need is a smart device connector.<U+2022> Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, Deezer, Spotify. You have all the choices in the world in choosing your music channel (except of course google and apple music)<U+2022> This Echo can connect with any of the other models of Echos, regardless of generation. This means that you just need to tap the Announce tab on Alexa and you can say/type a message of your choosing. All Echos in you have will be able to repeat what you said. I found this pretty niffy if you have kids throughout the house and you want them to come to you.<U+2022> The light-up time and temperature are bright and never overbearing.<U+2022> Echo can also call landlines, and any calls placed to numbers in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico for free. Note: Your Wi-Fi strength will be your indicator if the call quality will be good for you.<U+2022> The volume on these devices doesn¡¯t bring in any distortion or cranked tones when turning this device up high.<U+2022> Overall the volume balances heavily towards the highs and mid-tones. A decent performance for the size that it is.Cons and Oks:__________<U+2022> There is little to no volume bass in this device. The result makes an overall boomy experience. It¡¯s still decent sound but it wasn¡¯t something I was amazed by.<U+2022> This isn¡¯t a 360 design as the fabric covering the speaker covers only around 2/3rds of the Echo. This leaves a bare wedge in the rear.<U+2022> As much as the voice assistant is helpful, you still need to speak to Alexa with a ¡°specific¡± dialogue to get what you need. One of the benefits of Google in my eyes is the software in their mini. You¡¯re able to be more open in the conversational dialogue. Alexa isn¡¯t there yet.<U+2022> For the size, I have to say that you¡¯re getting a pretty large power brick.<U+2022> Alexa Guard is a cool feature where it can inform you in the app if Alexa hears a smoke alarm or breaking glass when you¡¯re out. I put this in the Con section because I kept getting false alarms from Alexa. I don¡¯t know if this was a glitch but I assume that a software update will fix this problem. When it does, then it¡¯s indeed a great tool to have, but don¡¯t expect it to be beneficial if you have an indoor dog/cat.<U+2022> Amazon does have a $5/month service where the save guard will listen to footsteps and opening doors. Don¡¯t know why you have to pay for this if the software is already on the device.<U+2022> I wish that you can buy the kids the designs for the Echo without the need to buy a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+.Bottom Line:__________This is either an alarm clock next to your bed or a nice radio when you¡¯re cooking. It¡¯s small, light, and you have the same Alexa power that Amazon¡¯s more expensive Echos have. With the price that it is, this Echo is a great way to see if you want to start making your house a ¡°smart¡± house, or even for someone who isn¡¯t tech-savvy. I do recommend that you fork over the extra $10 and buy this Echo with the backlit clock.Now for those who have any of the previous models, this isn¡¯t worth the buy. There aren¡¯t many significant changes. The main function of this Echo is the same performance as any other model (this is coming from someone who has the previous gen). Amazon still hasn¡¯t fixed the bass issue, then again you¡¯re paying not much for this.In the end, Amazon does a great job with the software of these devices. They¡¯re very simple to use and don¡¯t take that much power in using them. As I mentioned, one of Amazon¡¯s best perks is the vast variety of third-party dealers that the Echo can connect with. This is something that both the google mini and Apple's Homepod don¡¯t even come close to.Overall: An updated design built well for your bedroom or kitchen, but no need to upgrade from its predecessor.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer ",1
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,4th Gen. Twilight Blue w/ clock | A great upgrade,"The media could not be loaded. <U+00A0>I preordered this echo dot with clock and began using the first day available on November 5th 2020. I have multiple 3rd generation echo dots with clock and I love the upgrade to the 4th generation echo dot with clock. I chose the Twilight Blue color and it¡¯s great looking in person. It¡¯s a nice break with additional from the charcoal and sandstone color but still looks elegant and sleek in design. The light ring on the base and digital clock display and brighter and more crisp than the 3rd generation dot. It¡¯s very easy to read. The speakers and microphone are improved as well. The wire is a light grey color and the 15w Adaptor is rectangular in shape versus the square shape of the 3rd generation 15w power Adaptor. The manual buttons to control the echo are on top similar to last years model, but slightly recessed towards the back so they are not in view when staring directly and the front of the digital clock face. The speaker is more full in front of the dot and raises in the back where the wire plugs into dot. Setup was easy. I am considering trading in my older 3rd generation echo dots with digital clock for additional 4th generationecho dots with digital clock instead. ",1
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,"A big improvement. Worth the wait, and money!","The media could not be loaded. <U+00A0>Just received it today for my daughter. She loves it! For years she has been trying to get her hands on my echo devices. Now she has our own. I must say it is a big Improvement from the 3rd Generation Echo Dot.It has true surround sound.~ The LED clock on the front is very bright, and displays the time in standard, and military time. It has a time, and alarm indicator.~ The lights around the base increase and decrease according to the volume setting. This Echo dot puts on a nice little light show, if could almost be used as a night light.~ The buttons for the microphone, volumes up, down, and deactivation button sit on top of the 4th gen echo. With raised button symbols it can easily be accessed even in the dark.~ The sound quality is a real improvement. You can hear channels, lows, midrange, and highs. I mean it a small speaker, so you can't expect to get bass thumping, room shaking sound. But it will surprise you with how powerful it is for it's size.~ The microphone is a upgrade also. It's very sensitive, and can hear you practically whisper across the room.~ It still has the 3.5 mm output jack to connect to bigger speaker systems. So you can still get that room shaking sound. If you have big speakers you can make them smart.If you've ever had a smart speaker before(echo, google) or you have a whole host of skills aside from playing music you can activate from the Alexa app.~ Apps to set reminders, lists~ Set alarms, and timers.~ Play games, and trivia, and puzzles.~ Read to you from your Kindle books, and Audible acct.~ Control smart devices like smart lights, outlets, and even smart locks.- The one drawback (Con) that I found is that when - I have its side by side with the 1st, and 3rd generation Echo Dot it is actually a few seconds slower in responding.But overall the 4th generation Echo Dot is a improvement. You get for playing music, and it plays music better than the previous gens. Amazon continue to improve, and make a good thing great. ",1
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Great echo dot stereo system !!!!, I purchased two of these to achieve true stereo. The updated spherical design is a great update to the column design. Although the speakers are physically small they are relatively heavy. The sound quality is superb and the volume is more than adequate. Set up was easy using the app. These are great addition to my family room. ,1
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,Clock Display Too Bright," Alexa is awesome. We have 8 echos including our 2 echo-auto's.The new round echo dot w/clock has a clock display that is too bright at night. I have to turn it away from me at night so it does not shine so bright. Which means I manually have to turn the dot at night to see the time.Amazon needs a software update so the clock display brightness can be controlled to a bare minimum. Or if the display was red or perhaps blue would be better. The ""Adaptive Brightness"" feature does not work in this respect. ",1
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Doesn't hear well," I got this to replace a 3rd generation Echo Dot and quite frankly it sucks. With the 3rd gen I would have to say the wake word 1-3 times for it to recognize me, with this one it is taking 3-10 times. It never understands me the first time. Beyond that I don't care for the new form factor, it does not fit beneath my headphone stand like the old one.*Update* - March 30th, 2021 - It still doesn't respond as well as the 3rd gen, I want to get a 3rd gen to replace it but they're no longer in stock. Twice today it stopped listening while in the middle of giving it a command and that was after saying the wake word 10 times to get it to respond in the first place. This is the worst Echo device to date. ",1
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Echo dot 4th gen," Echo dot 4th gen.I've had all the versions of the Echos over the years and this one has issues ""hearing"" when you speak to it.I can literally be four feet from it and have to say Alexa three times for it to wake up and hear me.However, it hears me fine from another room when I'm talking to another echo.Annoying.Bought three of these and boxing them up and pulling out some of the old units. ",1
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Worth the money <U+0001F4B0>., Good looking <U+0001F44C>. Perfect size and sound quality is good. ,1
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Shares your internet," Just got this, and then I come to find out that it is sharing my internet connection for literally any stranger to use. I have data caps that this works against. I can't believe amazon would do this. ",1
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,One star due to being a paper weight without internet.," The 4th gen echo dot with clock was my first Alexa and I am looking into returning it. It will not do anything unless you have a wifi connection for it. The clock, alarm, everything is nonfunctional without an active wifi internet connection. I understand that many of the services require internet, but a clock and alarm should not require an internet connection. ",1
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,"Definite improvements, replacing a gen 2 Dot"," The media could not be loaded.<U+00A0>My 2nd gen dot had the speaker go out, so replaced it with this new one. Such an improvement!The speaker is slightly better.The voice recognition (which is my biggest gripe with the 2nd gen) is greatly improved. 9/10 in hearing now. Such a relief!The size is like a baseball now instead of a hockey puck. But uses about the same footprint.Overall more refined in appearance.Down side is that it doesn't run on USB any more. It has it's own plug now.I'm glad I got this!FYI: The display isn't just for the time, but shows timer and sometimes even text (scrolling). Watch closely as you set it up. Replacing this one with the old one in the app was as easy as it gets.NOTE: I needed a stand for it, so I made one myself. See the video. ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Modern look with clock and alarm," Love it, small has a clock.Very modern.Replaced older version ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Maybe mine was a lemon? BUT I'LL NEVER KNOW!," Super bummed. Bought this for my birthday.It wouldn't turn on with the command and other issues. I was willing to give the ball the benefit of the doubt because I have several Amazon devices. We spent the weekend trying to work out the kinks. I think we reset it 5 times. Today I chatted with an Amazon representative and we troubleshot the problem, thought it was fixed,but no. About 30 minutes after we ended the chat the problems started up again. This time it wouldn't play the song it was asked to even starting in the middle of the wrong song. So I chat with another Amazon representative and I did not want to troubleshoot anymore. I wanted to exchange it. Apparently I can only return it... that's not fair. It's an Amazon product sold by Amazon.Because they're on back order?I want to be on the back order list in hopes of getting one that works properly of course. So I'm just not happy <U+0001F611> ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,"Alexa, I think we should see other people"," Bought product because it was a newer, more stylish model to replace my older Echo Dot but never mind on that. Initial setup was a breeze but then Alexa stopped listening to me. Tried troubleshooting but got caught up in an endless loop of setting up. Also, I wanted to set up my Echo Wall Clock but couldn't. My clock was super simple to set up with my older echo for model but it seems that they changed the simplicity of set up. A newer model should ADD features but take away. No big deal, just gonna say bye bye to new Alexa and back to my old girl ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,DID NOT EVEN GET TO USE IT !," I did not even get the chance to use it. It is practically brand new. (Such a shame) I am returning it because it will not connect to the internet. I was on the phone with customer service soon as I received this piece of junk and they still could not figure out the issue. I do not have time to sit and repeat myself a hundred times (literally) because they are trying so bad to get the crap to work. I was not expecting this. I know there is nothing wrong with my internet because other devices are connected and this was an upgrade from the Echo Dot 3rd Gen in which I should have kept. I hate this product. Maybe this one has issues, however, at this point, I do not care and will be returning it pronto. I may try another one in the future. I am really unsure. Anywho.....MAKE SURE TO GET THE SERVICE PLAN! I purchased two echo dot 3rd gen. One died within a month. Had I known what I know now, I would have gotten the plan for it. ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Easy to install, The media could not be loaded.<U+00A0>This product is excellent if you have more than one you can use it as an intercom and listen to music in all your rooms or make announcements.You can use this to get the date listen to the latest news free music stations and weather. You can also make telephone calls with it. Installation was very easy all you have to do is download the Alexa app complete the instructions which is just giving it your cell phone number and your name you will need to know your Amazon information and your router information. it probably took me less than five minutes to install it. Please vote helpful Mine has a clock on it The numbers are digital on the front and on the top has press buttons for volume control and to mute the microphone ,2
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Had to keep unplugging it to get it to work right," I think she was defective, I would see the blue light when I spoke ""Alexa"" and I would ask her to do something and the light would go out and she didn't do anything.I can't very well scream at her while my husband is laying in bed sleeping!I would have to unplug it and wait a few min and plug it back up and it would then work.I had to do that a lot so I finally just sent it back and ordered a new one, so far so good on that one!I love the clock on it and when you ask what the weather is, it shows on the ball.The clock dims when you turn the lights off too and that is neat!So I am hoping that the new one works because I really do like it!!!! ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,The new privacy features made me buy it. love her!,"The media could not be loaded. <U+00A0>I had stayed away from Alexa for a long time, because it just freaked me out that ¡°she¡± was listening to everything, all the time... and all the other stuff I had heard negatively, but I saw the newer Gen one was on sale, and there¡¯s a button you can now press that makes it so she doesn¡¯t listen to you. Also, you can have her delete everything she has ever heard, and all sorts of other features now that protect your privacy.It¡¯s smaller than I thought it would be; wish it was a little bigger, but that¡¯s just my taste.Overall, she works great, and I plan on getting the light bulbs that work with her, and the Ring doorbell system, and I already ordered the FireTv Stick and remote- that gets here tomorrow! So now I¡¯m totally ¡°Alexafied¡±! lol ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,3,Great with one issue - Did I find a bug?," I'm so glad I ordered these.I ordered 2 of them.I have a FLIP 4 speaker that wouldn't work worth anything with the 2nd generation dots we have.The new ones have updated the bluetooth version and now the FLIP 4 stays connected and plays great.So everything is great except this.I have the app profile set up to auto connect to the speaker.I turn the speaker on and they connect.I play music while in the shower with no interruptions, finally.When I'm out of the shower, I can do one of two things and get the same result...1.) Say ""Echo, stop the music.""The music stops.I can ask echo anything I want and it won't respond at all.2.) I turn off the speaker and let the music continue to play through the dot.I can ask echo anything and it won't respond at all.To get it to respond, I have to hit the mute button and then hit it again to turn it off, THEN it responds.I can replicate this every time.Not a huge deal, but it's a little irritating. ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,Beware Before Downloading the Alexa App," It would help if the instruction manual would have a link for the correct download of the app. It says ""Download the Amazon Alexa app"" so I googled ""Amazon Alexa app"". Several links came up and unfortunately I picked the wrong one. The d/l gave me an error code and a number to call. The person answering got into my computer and tried to show I had an unsecure line and needed to buy a firewall to the tune of $400. Something just didn't feel right so I turned it down. I was able to find the correct link and the d/l and instructions went smooth. Now I was left with the horrid feeling that some stranger had gotten control of my computer...googled Alexa Dot Scams and found this very thing is happening to many people who fall for it and are out the money and stuck with a firewall that doesn't work ",2
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Best One Yet Because of More Than Its Shape .," I've got Echoes and Dots from 1st to 3rd generation and this Dot is leaps and bounds above my even 3rd gen stuff.First thing I noticed was the weight of the box. It felt just about the same as my 3rd gen Echo , but the wall wart felt lighter on the Dot .Upon removing and plugging in I saw a HUGE improvement in set up. It practically set itself up vs every other one gave me some sort of issue, be it Wi-Fi or connecting to smart devices , Bluetooth , or home theatre equipment . In 5 minutes it was set up , wake word changed and routines switched from my Echo to it . Does this mean Amazon knows more about my private stuff ? Maybe or maybe they got the software right .The sound quality with music is almost as decent as the full size Echo but bass distorts at a lower volume when listening to music. Vocal sounds are hard to tell which is which whenset the same in the Alexa app .I initially planned to set the Dot near my sofa and move the Echo across the den but the microphones on the Dot are so much more sensitive than the big brother the Dot ended up across the room and the Echo stayed where it was . I don't find anything wrong with the gen 3 Echo but the 4th gen Dot is just a lot better. No need to hit the mute on the tv to tell it to change the channel on my Hopper .The clock is why I got the thing and I really really am glad I paid the extra 10 clams to get the clock. I keep it manually set you 3 (30%) and it's plenty bright with or without lights on in the room. The fonts are crisp and large enough for my 56 year old eyes to easily, even on heavy allergy days . Just say ""Alexa what the current temperature "" and the clock changes to show the local weather affiliate temperatureand she also says what it is plus what the expected low for the day is . Adaptive brightness SUCKS on this thing though. It says try it and it'll adapt but I have not the patience and it sets the brightness so low I can't barely see it , even up close , and cannot read what the time is . It's like it's set on maybe 1 (5%) . Perhaps a software update will help but as of now setting it on 3 (30%) works well in all conditions and is not enough of a nuisance to take away my impression of this device being a huge upgrade from the 3rd gen Dot I got my daughters . If they add a clock feature to the new Echo I'll update mine to it but as of now the Dot is a great addition to my 20x28 man cave .Edit. I saw someone had found a way to make their Dot gray. I now have a charcoal Dot with clock and couldn't pass up the sale price along with 5 interest free payments for a Death Star (full size Echo ) after reading many many reviews and also seeing video reviews . The new Echo will be here in a few days and I'll use by blue full size somewhere else . ",3
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,6 months later and it will no longer connect - DUD," Purchased in November and I changed one of my network names and now it will not connect to either the new network or the old one. Spent time repeating troubleshooting steps and hours later, no resolution. I requested a replacement and was denied one because it's past the warranty.Heads up, amazon does NOT stand behind their products and I have a useless...idk rock...not sure what it can even be used for its not nice enough to decorate my coffee table.

05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Didn¡¯t work after 2 days, I¡¯ve have Echoes all over the house...never had a problemGeneration 4 lasted only two days and died no clock no nothing ,3
05-Nov-20,the United States,2,Needs work.," Echo Dot, 4th Gen, Glacier WhiteThis replaced a 3rd Gen Dot because of the clock. The clock is very bright in any light when set 10. However when Adaptive Brightness is turned on, the clock display dims and is barely visible in a sunlit room. Turn off Adaptive Brightness and the display is a beacon, very bright even in direct sunlight. This needs work.Frequently, I have to raise my voice considerably to get Alexa's attention. Once awake, my normal speaking voice is usually sufficient to order Alexa around.The audio quality is nothing of which to be proud. These aren't meant to be music speakers by any mean, so I give them a bit of a pass. But the sound is a typical Dot-muffled bass. The only was I can get clear intelligible responses from Alexa is to completer reduce the bass, and the midrange (slightly) and boost the treble to the maximum. Even then the audio only clears up when raised above normal conversation levels.The only plus over the previous Dot is the display, and as such - not so much. I would rather have the Dot 3 with display but it was more than I wanted to spend and the 4 was at a good price. ",3
05-Nov-20,the United States,2,Poor power cord plug design.," The cord placement is terrible when used as a nightstand clock.The cord doesn't direct to the back when you have the clock facing the bed.They should have designed the base like the older tap, which has a rotating ring with the cord plugged into it.The cord just wants to pull to the side of the nightstand and it looks horrible when viewing the nightstand face on. ",3
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Amazon lies about support for their products.," Amazon's products have gotten cheaper and cheaper over the years. Not necessarily cost, but quality and support. We have several echo dots from previous generations that haven't ever skipped a beat. They just work consistently. This new ""clock version"" I purchased for my wife November 2020 to use as a bedside clock. As of this writing June 2021 the thing is completely dead. After several times being unplugged, un/registered, reset, etc. it won't respond to any wake commands. Now even though my order states ""Replacement may be available until Dec. 2021,"" Amazon support will not simply replace it. I have to mail it back to them and only after complaining and escalating the issue they offered a ""one time"" courtesy replacement, (which was only offered after she saw how much $$$ I spend at amazon yearly.) This is just sad for a company this size and a device this cheap to have to go through this much hassle to get a replacement. I talked longer with tech support and consumed more ""staff time"" than the thing was even worth. Dealing with their customer support is just unbearable for anyone with half a brain. I am seriously considering my decision to go with all amazon products instead of a competitor.Update as of July16 2021. Still battling with Amazon on REPLACING the device that died after 6 months of use. I have talked to customer service who did some troubleshooting and were supposed to call back in 24 hours. That never happened. I chatted a second time and was told they would email me a return label, then give me a discount towards purchase of another device. That never happened. Finally I chatted just now and went through 2 escalations (if there is such a thing at Amazon.) All they would do for me is offer a 15% discount towards the purchase of a new device. Why would I buy another one when this one died in 6 months and they won't honor what my order states? For the record, the order states that ""replacement may be possible through Dec. 16th 2021"" and to call customer service. Turns out, that's a big lie. Even some Echo Shows that I bought on the same order show ""replacement may be possible through Dec. 2nd 2021"" So this will probably be my last Amazon device that I buy. The quality has gotten much worse over the years, customer support is non-existent, they clearly lie to their customers, and I don't have the time to agonize over a $40 device. I will be taking my money elsewhere in the future. AdiosAmazon! ",3
05-Nov-20,the United States,3,Not sure yet," Replace a Dot 3rd gen with this one one because I thought the new design had better sound and I wanted clock display. Setup was easy as expected.Having two issues which I'm working with.1. The LED is very bright and the adaptive brightness doesn't seem to work. Doesn't do anything and stays dim when light is on or off. Could be that it is sitting in a shelf and not under direct daylight ? Had to turn it off so see anything during the day...Brightness 2 seems to work fine, but it's almost too bright during the night (don't need a night light).2. The Voice recognition. Seems to me that the mic has sometimes problems picking up and interpreting it. Need to make sure there is a longer pause between the Words ""Alexa"" and ""the command"".Also sometimes, mic doesn't pic up and you have to repeat. Didn't see this with Gen 3Additional comment: Did some test with a flashlight and it seems the light sensor at the back of the Dot does not pick up changes of light if device sits in a shelf. Works great when device is out in the open. I think the device nees the sensor either on top or front. Bummer ",3
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,"DON""T BUY!!!Have to yell and repeat to get Alexa to activate. DOWNGRADE from Generation 3!"," This is a horrible device and a downgrade from Gen 3.There is a measurable and certifiable difference making Gen 4 WORSE at picking up your voice commands and responding.Typically, you must repeat at least once to get Alexa to answer.The Echo 4th gen microphones are so weak that other Echos (gen 3) in OTHER ROOMS will answer before this one does.Looks great...works horribly.Honestly, Amazon is hurting their reputation with this release.Read the other feedback from others...everyone is having the same problem!POOR DESIGN.RETURNED.

05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Great product!," We have had a couple Echo devices for a while now and just added this version to our son's room. As he is doing school remotely right now, it has been extremely helpful to set alarm reminders so he won't miss his Zooms throughout the day. He also uses it to set timers when he has to read or do other assignments for a particular length of time. We use the intercom feature a lot too so he can let me know whenever he needs my help with a school task while I'm in another part of the house without us having to yell to each other or (heaven forbid) go up/down the stairs a bunch of times. Also, he has always had a hard time falling asleep but rarely would let us play relaxing music to help... but because this device looks so cool and is fun for him to use, he actually is willing to have meditation music play and he falls asleep more quickly now. I love that we can also set it to automatically turn off after a certain amount of time. The clock display is another awesome feature. My son had some cheap alarm clock that had a display you could barely read in the light and it was impossible in the dark. This one is perfectly legible in both dark and light and isn't too bright in the dark that it's distracting. It's also nice that it will show a timer countdown as it nears the end and will show volume level if/when adjusting that. We are very pleased with this new version and would absolutely recommend it!

05-Nov-20,the United States,3,Tiny little speaker with not so great mic," I'm originally a GHome user. Have the whole house outfitted with them speakers. However with all the deals on the echo gear this holiday season and robust skills Alexa has to offer, I figured I'd jump on board. I have an echo dot 3rd gen, echo plus 2nd gen, echo flex, 2 of these echo dot 4th gen's with clock, echo show 8 and another echo dot 4th gen for my son in his bedroom. My original speakers for GHome had a digital clock display and temperature outside. So It was a must to have the clock display on this echo.The Speaker on this 4th gen sound crisp. Listening to music on it is pleasurable. Doesn't have much bass, but what can you expect from a tiny speaker the size of a baseball. I'm not an audiophile so it's good enough for me.My only issue is that the mic on these vs the echo dot 3rd gen is mediocre at best. I always enable whisper mode on all of these devices. One of my favorite features. The echo dot 4 has a tough time hearing me whisper. It hears the wake word, but I have to whisper loudly for it to catch what I asked for. Defeats the purpose of me whispering. I might as well just talk normally to it. Mind you, I'm only 2-3 feet away from the speaker laying in bed. While this perches on my nightstand. The 3rd gen was perfect in terms of mic sensitivity. Heard me clearly every-time I whispered.Alexa as a whole has poor voice recognition and follow-up conversation. I've linked my spotify account to it and every single playlist I asked for that GHome always played correctly, Alexa would play a completely different playlist. Terrible performance when it comes to voice recognition and understanding what the user is requesting. I made custom routine with my own wake phrase. It doesn't even recognize that correctly. Made me think my NYer accent was the reason it couldn't process them correctly. I began to annunciate words more clearly and it's still lacks proper recognition of what's being requested. I can't stand repeating my self and talking to it in an unnatural way. I honestly feel terrible for the people with heavy foreign accents, it must be even more aggravating.Outside of this issue, I'm facing with Alexa as whole. The echo dot 4 is stylish, pleasing to the ear and eye, and worth it at the current deal prices. Sadly, I can't see my self moving over to Alexa platform entirely just yet. I'll need to have both platforms to take advantage of voice assistance in my home. ",3
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,Worst voice sensitivity of all of my Alexa enabled devices," I received this 4th gen Echo Dot with clock a few weeks ago as a Christmas gift and was eager to install it as our new master bedroom alarm clock to replace the Echo Spot that had been there for the last two years. We didn't need a screen and camera by the bed, so this Dot with built in clock seemed to be the best upgrade.We have multiple echo devices (2x Gen2 Dots, 2x Gen3 Dots, a Fire TV cube, an Echo Spot, and a Sonos Move) and now this new Gen4 Dot. I have to say that the new Gen4 Dot has the worst voice recognition of any Echo or Fire TV device in my home. I have to be in the room, directly facing it, and speaking slowly and loudly for it to recognize me. It's sitting in the exact same position that the Echo Spot sat for the last two years. With the Echo Spot, I could be in the hall outside the bedroom or in the attached bathroom and it would pick me up and work just fine. Not so with the Gen4 Dot.It seems the Gen3 Dots are the best of the bunch with the Gen2s not far behind as far as voice sensitivity goes. It's a shame as I really like the Gen4's sound quality and the LED clock as it makes a perfect bedside alarm clock. Hopefully they'll fix the microphone sensitivity in a future upgrade, but for now, we're a bit disappointed in it's performance. ",4
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Broke after a month," I brought 2echos during the holidays. Delivery was slow. Worked fine for the first month and then it started disconnecting. I was using it as an alarm so that's why I brought the one with the clock. Now I have to return and wait 4 months for a new one. It is currently 1/18/2021 and the estimated delivery for the replacement is June 2021. I feel very disappointed in the lack of quality and Amazon does not seem to be standing behind the item. Also, Amazon tech support seems kind of clueless, so, just hope you don't run into any problems. I am just hoping the second one doesn't break on me.Finally, I like to say if you are using this as an alarm and run into the disconnecting issue all night long you will be looking at the bottom like showing it is trying to connect. It connects and 20 minutes later and it does it again and it happens all night. That's, why I am returning it as the light, is bright and disturbing in bed. Hopefully, this was just a dud.1/20/2021 - Sad I just dropped my review to one star. Amazon tried to makeup and promised me this can be returned at Kohls because it is close to me. I was happy but the rep lied. Sadly they told me to just choose to return and by me from home and I would be offered to return to Kohls. As I stated the reps don't seem to know much and they are wrong again. Is the company that I ordered a book from in 1997 and completely trusted, sadly NO! I should have returned both echos. Hopefully, the other one does not break, Very sad to say I feel a personal investment in making Amazon the company they are today and they bite the hand that feeds. Not good! One word SEARS!Sincerly a X Amazon Fan and loyal shopper. :( ",4
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Broke after three month warranty," My son had loved this is he would play music in his room a couple times a week with it, and just liked having some thing that had the capability of talking to him even though he never remembered to ask it anything <U+0001F602>I was so pleased with the purchase, that I bought one from my room as well.The warranty was apparently only for three months, because 4 1/2 months later it no longer works, and Amazon says there¡¯s nothing they can do about it besides giving me a percentage off if I want to upgrade. There¡¯s literally not an upgrade available though, I would just be buying the exact same product again.Thankfully, the one I bought from my room is still under warranty, so they¡¯re sending me a new one. I have no idea why both of my clock echo dots stopped working on the same day, yet my second and first generation echo dots are still working just fine. coincidentally, I got an echo show, and they stopped working right after I set it up. I unplugged the echo show, and neither of them would connect so I can¡¯t say for sure those two things are related.I find it a little bit ridiculous that a $60 clock only has a three month warranty though. Yes, I understand it is so much more than just tell the time, but that¡¯s what we used it for, and to have background music. ",4
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Do not buy this if you want something that works, This item came defective. Everytime you touched it shut off.Offered to replace it. Waited almost 2 weeks and arrived with no power cord. They said keep it and we will ship a new one. Later that day I received an email from them saying they don't have one to send me and also send the other one back. They told me to throw it in the garbage and then dig it out and return it....seriously. I'm supposed to get a refund. Ill take it but not sure how much more I'll be purchasing from them. I hate apple but they are sounding way better ,4
05-Nov-20,the United States,2,I wanted to love it but she just doesn't listen well," I have lots of the 3rd generation echo dots around my house but I decided to replace my alarm clock with the 4th gen Echo Dot with Clock. I was going to get the 3rd gen with clock but when I ordered the 4th gen was the same price and I thought, hey, its newer, it has a bigger number and the round shape may stop me from setting things on top of it. Well, I kind of regret my decision. My master bedroom has an attached sitting room where my wife has a 3rd gen set up.The microphone on the 3rd gen is remarkably better. When I am laying in bed, the 3rd gen dot (in another room) will pick my my voice better than the 4th gen sitting right next to me. What's to like: Sound is better, the clock is handy and isn't too bright. What's not to like: Microphone doesn't work as well and while the round shape does stop me from stacking things on top of it, it is otherwise dorky looking and stands out. Really the first disappointing Echo Dot experience I've had. Maybe the shape of the room and the directionality of the microphones make this the wrong product for me.If you were planning on putting it on your night stand, I'd steer clear.If you are setting it up in your kitchen or office, probably not bad if you like having a croquet ball on your counter.

05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Someone is not talking," UPDATED: Christmas 2021 - Amazon notified me they would replace the unit I returned and, true to their word, I received it the week before Christmas (no word as to what the problem was, no surprise there). I plugged it in and it was connected and functioning perfectly in less than 2 minutes. I stand by my assertion that Amazon is aware of an issue with this model and, in my case, took care of it only after I escalated my complaints. Unfortunately, my local supplier is not Amazon and is not willing to replace the other one (They are still convinced that I¡¯m too old and stupid to figure it out for myself and that¡¯s not their problem. Kids these days, amiright?)I have purchased two of this device, one from Amazon and another from a local store. Both were connected to my network and functioning just fine until about 10 days ago. Both Echo DOT devices stopped functioning and the indication was they were no longer connected to the internet. I should mention that I have several other devices that continue to function just fine (including an Echo Studio, TV, laptop, Ring Doorbell, etc). The only thing that does not function are the Echo Dot (4th gen with clock). I, literally, spent an entire day messing with them and tried everything suggested multiple times with no change. When I called Customer Service, i spoke to four different people (they kept handing me off when they couldn't help) and finally the last guy said he would process a return, not to replace but to evaluate and advise. There is OBVIOUSLY an issue with this model, but Amazon isn't acknowledging or addressing it as far as I can tell. I don't mind if there is an issue that needs to be fixed. Technology is complex and stuff happens, but to continually tell me to do the same thing and ""hoping"" for a different result? That's the definition of INSANITY isn't it? Come on Amazon, either take care of the problem so we can use what we have paid for or admit you don't know what it is and let us decide for ourselves if we want to keep buying this junk or not. Just stop treating us like we are the problem and provide a solution, please. ",4
05-Nov-20,the United States,2,Gen 4 and Sound Still Sucks," Have quiet a few Echo Dots Gen 2 through 4. and I'm so disappointed that my newest 4th GEN Echo Dot with Clock has such poor sound quality. Now I'm not talking Music, I don't expect a lot there and as far as music I'm pretty happy with the sound. The voice is so muffled and the 4th GEN isn't much better than the second. Here is what I mean I ask Alexa what the weather is. then I ask my Google Mini 2nd GEN what the weather is and it is Soooooo Much more understandable and clear. Now granted my hearing isn't what it used to be but the Google Mini GEN 2 is magnitudes better. The reason I have so many ECHOs is they run deals all the time and just about give them away. ",4
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Only lasted 6 months then died.Poor design?," After 6 months of use, the display went out and the led ring is is spinning green on blue.Support says it is a hardware issue ""would you like to purchase a new one""?Are you kidding, $60 and it fails at 6 months.Funny it is even protected by an Amazon surge suppressor strip.I have the original Echo 1 and it's till going.This isn't the 20th century; electronics typically are designed to last longer.If there is early failure, reputable manufacturers make good on it and replace it.

05-Nov-20,the United States,3,Resolved: Failed after 6 months and 90 DAY WARRANTY ONLY!!!!," 9/2021. Updated:Amazon support reached out to me to discuss the issue.Ultimately they provided a replacement Dot that appears to be working well.I do appreciate their help!7/2021:Purchased device end of November 2020, was very happy with it overall- would like the clock to dim more but I worked around it.At about 6 months it started periodically locking up, then it got worse and worse.Caused me to over sleep on work days, would sometimes suddenly glow bright blue at 3 in the morning when it locked up.Skipped my alarms and routines and then created random alarm that saved me from over sleeping.Reminders started coming on at about 3 times the set volume.Amazon support would work with me then escalate a ticket supposed to get back to me within 5 days- twice and they never got back to me.Final tech chat and they were having me do all the same things over again as they had no record of previous chats.One rep disconnected on me when I suggested maybe I should look for Non-Amazon smart device since Amazon was only providing a 3 month warranty even though account say ¡°may be possible to return¡± nearly 13 months after the purchase date.My advice- don¡¯t buy it or get the 3 year extended warranty.NEVER had a problem with Amazon before but this one has really frustrated me with having at least 6 chats and not standing behind their product.Lack of follow up and lack of seeing previous chats with things we tried.They offered me a 15% discount on a new one -ha.

05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Lemon.Stopped working in 6 months," The media could not be loaded.<U+00A0>I bought this product for Christmas 2020. It worked really well for about 6 months...At first, it would lock up and I'd dismiss it as a fluke in the network or something.Unplug and re-plug it in and it would work for 2-3 weeks with no issue..After a month or two, it started happening more and more.I started to troubleshoot it and followed all the recommended steps.Factory re-sets. Changed Wi-Fi settings in my router.I went to the Amazon Forums for support and found quite a few people were having issues.I added a smart switch and my old 3rd Gen Echo to remove any doubt on network connectivity.I could unplug and plug it back in without moving it and show the Gen3 is getting network signal just fine.Now it is happening daily.The Forum support was unable to help, and the only suggestion from Amazon was ""buy another one"".No thanks.TLDR: Stopped working after 6 months. No support (short warranty period of 90 days).Buyer Beware. ",4
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Short and sweet -PASS ON THIS ONE WAIT FOR A NEWER VERSION!," It's different. I like that it has a clock, however, This new version is not good at all!! It comes to life on it's own and at times it responds in a different language when I don't even ask it anything.. spooky! And when I tried telling it to stop it would begin rambling.I've become so annoyed with it I have almost recreated the scene from 'Office Space'! Avoid headaches and throat pain, yeah, throat pain from hollering it at telling it to stop... ",5
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,"Very useful, functional and funny assistant, with good sound quality!","The media could not be loaded. <U+00A0>Well, first thing I would like to say is that, before submitting a review, specially a bad review, because you can't do this or that with the Echo Dot, please learn how to use it. Alexa even guides you to things to do and configure during the initial setup.With that said, I gotta say that it is more than I expected. It was setup very easily, the Alexa App is very useful and easy to understand with few practice. Alexa system is straight forward and I like that, as I am not into the ""super conversational/human mimic"" system, I just want an assistant to understand my orders and my request, and Alexa does it very well, so far.For those complaining about the sound quality, I can say that, as someone that enjoy music and HiFi sound, as someone used to the Bose, Sennheiser, JBL, AKG or Harman Kardon sound quality, the Alexa speaker has a good and decent sound quality, considering its size. I read many people saying it has zero bass, but that is not true, It does have a bass level, of course it won't be like having a subwoofer, but it does have, specially when listening to EDM, Pop, Classic Music or Jazz, it sounds very good (refer to the attached video, please use headphones or good speakers to appreciate the sound), and the best part about its sound is the Alexa App Sound settings with a 3-Ways Equalizer, I can't be more satisfied. If I want louder sound with extra super ultra HiFi quality, I can use the 2.1 Speakers connected to my gaming computer.I also read some reviews stating that the display is too bright, well, it can be also adjusted with the Alexa App, there is even an Adapative Display Brightness, perfect for me, when I turn off the lamp next to my bed, the Echo Dot reduces the display brightness automatically to a point it does bother while readable in the dark.I can even listen to my favorite radio stations via TuneIn service, I just ask Alexa and she plays it. Same applies for the audio streaming or music services, I just ask Alexa to play my music from Spotify and she does it!So basically it is just matter of getting familiar with the Alexa App and it all runs smoothly. Just setup the Skills you want and enjoy, including the funny ones. It can also controls the Amazon TV without the remote control. Super cool!All around, so far so good. I do recommend it. ",5
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,I'm guessing most or all of the positive reviews are from people who've never owned an Echo.," I've had Echo units since the first generation.I have the tower, several prior-gen Dots and two Echo Shows.During the Christmas shopping season of 2020, I bought a white dot with the clock on Amazon and my wife bought a black dot without the clock from another approved retailer.They look nice and we tried to like them, but the sound quality is pathetic at best when paired to older units.The sound is harsh, tinny and grating.If you know what an Echo historically sounds like and sound quality means anything to you, it's unlikely you'll be happy with this new Dot.Aside from the terrible sound quality, it functions as well as any other Echo device.If you intend to run it at a very low volume, you might not mind the cheap speaker.At least they were super cheap (I guess that explains the sound quality).

05-Nov-20,the United States,1,No free Amazon Music PRIME on Amazon Echo," As a prime member, I can stream music from Amazon Music PRIME for free on my phone or my computer, as they claim.But when I stream music from Amazon Music PRIME on my new Amazon Echo, it is no logger free there - it puts commercials.In a chat with a rep he says that Amazon Music PRIME is not free on Echo (has commercials) but only free using a subscription of Amazon Music UNLIMITED.That's a cheat for me, and I don't like it.I am going to return the Echo and get Apple HomePod or Google Nest, which practically has same functions and I'd assume will stream the Amazon Music Prime for free as I get on my Phone or computer.Good bye Echo, it was nice meeting you.

05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Decent device¡¦when it works.," Simply put, the Echo dot with clock is a nice little device, until it freezes up and stops working. Once broken, there isn¡¯t anything you can do because Amazon only offers a 90 day warranty on their products, even for glitchy products that have no damage. I haven¡¯t had any issues with the other 4 Echo devices in my home and a factory reset did not resolve the problem. Amazon support has also been a shocking disappointment.### Pros* The Echo Dot provides an always on clock to keep track of the time.* Alexa functionally works great with my other smart home devices and is great at trivia.* The clock light can be dimmed and you can change the light color of the Echo Dot when it responds to an action word.* The sound is get loud to hear in. Another room.### Cons* The device freezes up and stops responding for no apparent reason.* Amazon doesn¡¯t stand by their product after the 90 day warranty period is up, even if the issue is reported before the warranty expires.* The sound isn¡¯t dynamic so don¡¯t expect to replace your stereo system.### SummaryI do not recommend the Echo Dot with Clock and would return it if I could. The device is effectively useless as a smart speaker, which is the primary reason I purchased it. ",5
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,One Major Issue," You cannot pair this with a 3rd Gen in Home Theater or Stereo mode. Which is sad there¡¯s no backwards compatibility on this. I only have the one 4th Gen and can¡¯t really use it as intended. Only thing you can do is put the different Gens in a group so they play music together, but that¡¯s all. It kind of pushes you into buying a couple when you may have already invested in the technology, albeit a little older. No thanks! I figured one day the old Gens would be useless hockey pucks, but not so soon. Well on with the review...One thing that did surprise me was the size. Diameter-wise, it is smaller than its predecessor. May be my perception, but it appears to be a rather large orb in the photos so I made unnecessary room for it. It¡¯s a compact little package and the speaker is forward-facing so sound is a bit fuller and clearer even on lower levels. The LED clock is sharper and a tad larger than the last, so I can make it out in the dark without glasses. Thumbs up! And the light ring is now at the base which is smaller and less intrusive in terms of brightness. (It resembles a tiny alien spaceship with its unearthly glow, in case you¡¯re into that or just like being notified of its presence.) In terms of the mic, it¡¯s pretty sensitive. Initially, Alexa had a lot of trouble responding with the slightest background noise, but could pick up commands in the next room with another Dot behind closed doors. Go figure. You do have to setup a new voice profile, so maybe she has to learn your voice again? The new feature of going into low power mode when not in use is nice, since there are long periods where the Dot is idle.Overall it¡¯s a good looking and fully functional upgrade, but honestly most of the tweaks are in the chassis (easier, flexible buttons too) and what¡¯s not available, could be fixed in a good software update. Unless you¡¯re just into the new design, then by all means grab it. But you¡¯re not missing a heck of a lot of advancement sticking with your 3rd Gen. ",5
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,why no gen 3 music left and right share?, All i really wanted was the 3gen with clock but since they are all sold out. I got the 4th gen and to my suprise i lost stereo sound between generations!What a waste of money and time.If you have gen 3 stay with it .if and when they ever get gen 3 back in with clock i will buy thet and toss this into basment for a standalone dot. ,5
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,New Echo Dot 4 - Must Have!," The new Echo Dot 4 is phenomenal. The clock display is easy to ready, sound quality is great, and as always, setup was a piece of cake through the Alexa app on my iPhone. Highly recommend if you are wanting one with the clock display.The brightness of the clock is perfect. Easy on the eyes. ",5
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,Overall it's an amazing little device," All conspiracy theories aside ;-) , I think it's a great little device.It's my first Echo dot (my first ""Alexa"" device of any kind),as I'd never been drawn to the whole idea.However, I had a chance to get a fourth generation (with clock) at a good price so figured I'd try it to replace my alarm clock.....it was easy to set up, and I was immediately hooked.I even went out and bought some smart bulbs (Merkury) and hooked them up in a couple different rooms and my hallway....This was something I said I'd NEVER do.....and man, do I like the convenience and the ""cool factor"" of being able to say ""Alexa, turn hallway light on"" and like magic (ok, maybe not magic) there is light!I'm purchasing a few more bulbs and will try some other smart devices...as well as probably adding a couple more Echo's or Echo dots for other rooms.I won't list all the things you CAN do with it, as there are a gazillion...and plenty of videos on Youtube.Is it perfect?No.Do I have complaints/nitpicks?Yup....1) I find that Alexa's voice sounds muffled a lot of the time....even after trying to adjust the audio settings....which seem to work for the material like music, etc....but not her voice?2) I find the sound balance between her voice and music or other soundsto not be very good....in my case, I have to turn the unit up to hear her voice, but when the news reports or music or whatever start they are BLARING in comparison.It would be REALLY nice (are you listening Amazon?) if they had 1 volume control for her voice, and 1 for sounds/music/etc...so you could find a good balance.It would also be nice if the EQ settings effected the Alexa voice (if it already does, maybe I just couldn't tell)3) A couple of the ""skills"" (Song Quizfor one) have seemingly caused the unit to freeze, where I've had to unplug it and start it again.....that could just have been bad luck on my part, I suppose.4) The overall sound quality is.......ok....I've read some people really complain about how small it sounds....well, surprise, surprise, it IS small.....of COURSE it's not going to sound like a nice audio system.It's not great....but it sounds ok for my purposes at the moment....but, if I was using it as my primary music source, I'd , either hard wired or wirelessly, run it out to a better system or speaker(s).At the moment, those are the main things I've found ""wrong"" with it.....And even with those things, it's a good 4 - 4.5 stars.

05-Nov-20,the United States,5,You must know what the different lights Alexa puts out.," I feel the time light could be a litter brighteror better yet ! put a dimmer to aloud people to choose how bright they would like it. I have Alexa sitting up high, I like it up high yes I can't see the color lights, can't see the notification light, for an example, I was expecting a package from Amazon and Alexa notification did come on but could not see the notification light until I stand up I'm sure I'm not the only one who does this. What I do like is when I got Alexa for Christmas last year I said to my self ( Great we are going to have problems setting it up or it's not going to work out.) But! I was wrong easy to set up, easy to hook up to where I can turn off certain devices which is cool, Now I love my Alexa, would really recommend everyone must get, will make your life a little easier. WHAT I RECOMMEND IS FOR ALEXA IS THAT MAYBE CHANGE THE LOCATION OF THE LIGHTING. HERE IS A FEW SUGGESTIONS I HAVE. EIGHTER PUT THE LIGHT EIGHTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BALL OR PUT THE LIGHT ON TOP OF THEBALL OR EVEN COOLER, MAKE THE HOLE BALL LIGHT UP, LIKE WHEN N.Y. DROPS THE BALL, TURN COLORS FOR NOTIFICATION AND TO LET YOU KNOW ALEXA IS ON WHEN YOU SAY ALEXA, YOU HAVE THE BLUE COLOR FOR WHEN SHE TURNS ON, ANDYELLOW FOR NOTIFICATION, AND OTHER THINGS, SO TO MAKE IT EASIER PUT THE LIGHT ON TOP OF BALL OF MAKE THE HOLE BALL TURN THE COLORS FOR DIFFERENT THINGS, LIKE ALEXA NOTIFICATION. TO ALOUD PEOPLE WHO PUT THEIR ALEXA UP HIGH. JUST A SUGGESTION.I guess what I'm saying is when people like myself put it up high we can't see the notification light of any notifications or when you say Alexa I can't see the light is on or I walk up to it.

05-Nov-20,the United States,2,"Just initial impressions, will update later ( 2 updates so far )"," I was excited to finally receive the new ED w Clock, there was huge demand.Everything arrived fine and the shipping box was more appropriately sized instead of some great box for the tiny contents.It also makes it feel like something very impressive must be inside.The nice parts:Sound is much improved over the older models.It has a CLOCK!( of course ) and the LED illumination is adjustable or automatic.You don't have to be able to see it to snooze the alarm - you can keep your eyes closed and just reach out and tap it on the noggin.The not-so-nice parts:The power adapter is changed and doesn't have a replaceable cord.The power cord is pretty short, too short.The light ring (now on the bottom) will sometimes illuminate brightly - during the middle of the night, for unknown reasons.Alexa is still a product in development.Some day...( it still triggers incorrectly quite often and relies too much on 3rd parties )update 1:another not-so-nice part - the only way to get the outside temperature to show is to ask about it and then it will launch an entire weather report instead of just the temperature.update 2: Apr 7, 2021more on the power adapter - the brick itself is so large it takes up 3 spots on the battery backup I've got it plugged into.Also, when I ask to 'show me the volume' it will increment the volume level.A trouble ticket is being started on this one.Another item - it appears that while you may pair two of these devices for stereo sound, you can't use them as speakers for, say, an Amazon Fire HD 10 Tablet.That's a BIG downer and SHOULD be mentioned somewhere as this was the biggest reason I bought 2 of them.Actually, the ONLY reason I bought 2. ",6
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Great Upgrade," I will state from the start that I bought this to upgrade from the Echo Dot 2nd generation I have not had the 3rd generation so I can't compare it to that.I was interested in this new dot because the reviews said the sound was good for the size and I liked that it has a clock on it.Overall I have been very happy with it so far. The sound quality is fantastic compared to the 2nd generation. Is it perfect no of course not but for the price and size I think it's good. I bought the blue one and like it but don't understand why they could not have made it in black as well. I like the clock it works well and I can set a routine to turn the clock off when I go to bed at night since I don't like having it on at night. I wish they had built in a setting to have it turn off for a set time but thankfully using routines did that trick. I know some people don't like the round shape of the new dot but I don't mind it I was kind of sick of the hockey puck and so now I have a bowling ball I guess but I like the look overall. In the end, I am quite happy with the 3 I bought and I am glad to see Amazon doing better with sound quality with each upgrade. I highly recommend this product. ",6
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Household helper," I like these with the clocks.I have the Dot with the clock in my bathroom, the Spot as my alarm clock, etc. & now this one for my office.With the Echo base in my living room, I can have access everywhere as well as music in multiple rooms.It's kinda funny how the Spot in my bedroom has more personality than the others.""She"" will tell me goodnight, hope you had a wonderful day, or pleasant dreams.If I say thank you, she responds with you're quite welcome, my pleasure, etc. Sometimes they'll call me by name, but not often.I need to get them personalized a little more.(Sometimes we have to argue about what it is I've asked for!)Quite handy for quick reminders, timers, etc. like when you're watering the lawn.Perfect companions with Satellite radio without having to buy their extra plan & receivers. Hands free all the way! ",6
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Alexa hears everything......

05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Device produced in 2020 has more problems than a 1st gen device from 2014," The media could not be loaded.<U+00A0>I purchased the Amazon 4th gen Dot in October of 2020. It was running fine until coincidentally about a year in it started crapping out on me. I would ask it questions and suddenly it would lock up with no response and the blue ring running forever. I'd unplug and plug in the Dot, wait for it to boot up then it would work fine for a bit. Sometimes for 10 minutes, sometimes for days. Then suddenly it would lock up again. I don't know if there's a keyword or phrase I'm saying to cause this, but it's unacceptable for a product after only one year to have such a major malfunction. In the video you'll see me comparing this 4th gen Dot to a 1st gen Echo I bought back in 2016, but keep in mind it was released in 2014 so that device could be as much as 7 years old. I beat that device to crap (verbally) and it's still running like a champ. I spoke with customer service and they said I was past my warranty period so they couldn't do anything for me. It's unacceptable for me to have paid my hard earned money for a device that hardly lasted a year. 1 star. ",6
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,"Great when it works....but when stops working, there is zero real support from Amazon"," Alexa is beyond unreliable, right now we are sitting it the dark because yet again Alexa in both our Echo's has decided to not find any of our smart switches...but thats ok, wait an hour or so and Alexa will work just fine....until it stops working again.What makes this worse is there is zero support from Amazon, their standard answer is ""reset your echo back to factory and start over"".If I could return them and all the switches and get a refund I would, and then look for a system that not only works, but actually has real support for when it doesn't.I have reached out to Amazon and to the makers of the smart switches, but they are just like our two echos......unresponsive.There has to be a better system.UPDATE: June 2021Well, here it is, 6 months of owning 2 Echos....and still the are totally unreliable. Came home tonight to a dark house, and Alexa refuses to connect to any of the smart lights...and tomorrow, when I go to call Amazon support it will work just fine.I truly wish I could send back the 2 echos I have and all the smart lamps and replace them with a system that works consistently, instead I'm stuck with high tech paperweights. At least I now know why the units are shaped like a ball, it's so they are easy to unplug and throw in the trash.The worst part is how totally unhelpful Amazon support has been, their standard answer is ""factory reset it and start over"" is still all they can offer.You would think by now Amazon would have got this tech working correctly. Very very disappointedUPDATE June 20thWell, today both my Echos have finally lost their minds. and no amount of resetting and reprogramming will get them to work. To their credit Amazon did reach out to me but their live support is only open 9am - 6pm weekdays, and Alexa seems to always go rogue in the evening or over the weekend.Bottom line is an Echo is a fun device to play music on, it's a decent alarm clock, and it works for reminders, but if you want it to do home automation, for the sake of your sanity, get something else.

05-Nov-20,the United States,3,Nope...not if you wear glasses," Okay...I had a Dot and found it very useful. It sits atop the tall dresser in my room. When I needed to make space on my nightstand for a humidifier, I got the bright idea to order a Dot with a clock, to replace the one on the dresser, thereby eliminating the bulky alarm clock that sits on the night stand. Already gave the alarm clock to the Goodwill. However, my plan was not well thought out. I wear glasses and the Dot's digital display is small and faint, making it impossible to see across the room. Sure, I could put my glasses on, which I have done, but I still need to squint and reason out that I am seeing a 6, not an 8, because it's not light out. Or, I could say Alexa, what time is it? The problem with that is that Chatty Cathy can't just state the time...she has to add more information, like ""Did you know I can recite all of the books of the Bible?"" And then you're awake, and thinking about Leviticus. This Dot, unlike my last one, also seems to have trouble with word recognition. 'She' has twice now, responded to words like 'unless' or 'also' thinking I said her name. I have included a photo of the device at night, taken at two feet. Take your glasses off and see if you can read it. ",6
05-Nov-20,the United States,3,"Piece of junk, breaks in less than 6 months"," Never noticed Amazon only provides a 90 day warranty. The think broke in less than 6 months and has the blue light on the base go on every 24 hours and refuses to take any commands until I unplug and re-plug it in. Spoke to their support and they tried a reset but the same problem persists. They then tell me it is out of warranty and to bad! Was told to bad sorry!I was under the impression it came with a standard 1 year warranty (as almost every other electronic product). The 90 day warranty tells me they expect it to break!Stay away, its a piece of junk!----------------UPDATED: After writing this review I heard from an Amazon representative. He was saying that it is looking like there is a pattern of defects here with similar problems as to what I have described and they do not know why it happens. He replaced the Echo Dot 4th Gen and had me send the old one back so they can perform more tests.Glad they reached out and hopefully they can figure out why the problem is happening to people! ",6
05-Nov-20,the United States,2,I bought a lemon!," I have several Alexa devices scattered around my home and they all work really well, apart from this one! I really just wanted an alarm clock for the bedroom and liked the features on this so decided to add another 'Alexa' to the family. This one drops offline continuously and the alarm goes off maybe 1 day in 5 (not ideal). In addition, it suddenly shoots up to maximum brightness in the middle of the night for no reason and the blue light on the bottom just spins and spins until I unplug it in!I got in touch with tech support twice so far and they just tell me to reset it (I'm getting extremely familiar with that process) and then finish the conversation by telling me it's too late to return it, which is not really very helpful. It then works for a few hours and....off it goes again. I'm disappointed in both the product and the not-so-technical support. I hate leaving negative reviews but I can honestly say this deserves it.

05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Great interactive alarm clock with minor flaws!," The 4th Gen Echo Dot speaker with alarm clock is a step up from the ole AM/FM radio alarm clock. Although, some of the AM/FM radio alarm clocks seemed to last a forever!**Disclaimer** - I purchased the Echo Dot speaker w/ alarm clock elsewhere. However, writing a review because this is a useful device.Before the Echo Dot speaker clock, I had to ask ""Hey Siri what time is it?"" or ""Hey Alexa what time is it?"" That annoyed my spouse and disrupted my sleep. The Echo Dot speaker clock is an attractive looking device, so it fits well in the bedroom, kitchen or even family room. The actual time display is sharp, brightens when a light is turned on and dims when all lights are off.The ring light on the 4tb Gen Echo Dot Speaker Clock is now at the bottom. Therefore, it is harder to see. I am not sure if this impacts how well the speaker hears your voice but some times you have to speak louder. That is only flaw I noted. Setup of the speaker clock is a breeze, just open the Alexa app on your phone and follow the speakers voice prompts.It works like a regular Echo speaker. You can control smart plugs, listen to the radio, set routines, and yes, setup a daily alarm. The speaker is small but sounds good. The audio is crisp, clear, and not tinty. On top of the speaker are simple volume controls, mic mute and you can tap to snooze.You can customize the display on the clock:Adding such things as outdoor temp, timer, and change volume, equalizer, and brightness.

05-Nov-20,the United States,2,Make sure you purchase the extended warranty," I purchased 2 of these. One in February 2020, and the second one in November2020, (which I gave as a Christmas gift). Well the one that was purchased in February started having problems. Everyday I had to unplug, restart and reset the Dot in the Alexa app.I could not depend on it for my alarms, or anything that I needed reminders for, (calenders, to do lists ect.). I am now regretting giving the second one as a Christmas gift, and hope it doesn't start having problems. When I contacted customer service, (3 times, which is another terrible review in and of itself, because of the run around I got), I was finally told that the only thing they could do for me, since I was outside the one year warrany, was give me a 15% discount on a new Dot. I refuse to purchase another one because these are not cheap, (I am on a fixed income), and I don't want to take the chance that another one will stop working just over a year of having it. I cannot afford to purchase one of these every year. I am a prime customer, and have been one for many years. You would think that Amazon would treat their loyal customers better than that, but I guess not. So when my membership comes up for renewal I plan on canceling my membership as well. So in closing, I am giving this 2 stars, only because it did work for the first year. If you plan on purchasing one of these, I highly, highly recommend you purchase the extended warranty. And to you Amazon, PLEASE START TREATING YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS BETTER OR YOU WILL BE LOSING MORE OF THEM. ",7
05-Nov-20,the United States,2,scam lurking?," it seemed to be a simple set up but i call for some help. somehow, my call was intercepted by ONE CLICK GEEKS. i was wary but the high pressure and misleading sales, if you can call it that, drew me in. this company repeatedly stressed they are the ""only company licensed to work with amazon alexa."" and inferred that this service for 'security' was necessary to use alexa. when asked how much time all of this would take, enrolling and setting up alexa' was fast. my phone indicates 2 INcoming calls 40 minutes long. i stressed repeatedly all i wanted was set up echo dot alexa. with that insistence, they stressed i was basically under attack by many threats/hackers/thieves.(like themselves?) and to create fear, they somehow managed control of my desktop showing how many ""attacks"" were attempted, despite me having a password protected wifi system and virus protection.when finally connected to a tech to set up alexa, he knew next to nothing. only complained about how slow my wifi was. which it was not.it was only after his supervisor assisted. he set up alexa in about 2 minutes. it was so miserable an experience, and amazon's 'not us' attitude, echo dot went back! Beware!!! one click geeks are prowling using the amazon platform.a Tech savvy person helped after this disaster and my stars are based upon those operations. ",7
05-Nov-20,the United States,3,This one is small and disappointing," We had a large first generation Alexa that stopped working, the sound was amazing on that one and so was the voice recognition. I got this one because I thought it would be a good replacement for the large one that died. Well, I hate to say but other than the dimly lit digital clock display this Alexa is horrible! She doesn't hear us half the time, even if we're right next to her! The speaker is pathetic, I actually used the 1st generation one as my stereo so to speak and this sad little new thing is more like a clock radio. Don't waste your money on this one, the clock is not worth it! ",7
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,"Good, compact Echo device with excellent minimal display, decent sound quality"," First things first. ""Twilight blue"" in no way resembles any shade of blue. It isjust basic gray.If you can live with that crazy color bait and switch, it is a pretty good device, especially if you grab it when it is on sale.Setup is effortless if you already have some Echo devices, which provides a back door for this thing to gain access to your wi-fi network and the internet without you providing a password. Sort of spooky but if you hate having to do things like entering wi-fi passwords during setup, this is the device for you.It also connects automatically to your account.Just plug it in, stand back and do nothing. Pretty amazing, unless you are paranoid about your privacy.I could do without the long chatty ""here's what you can do"" intromonologue Alexa does whenyou first start it up.I have a whole houseful of Alexa devices.I already know all that stuff.But I guess newcomers to the Alexa universe probably will be impressed by all of this.Sound quality is quite good for such a small device.Way better than the old hockey puck Dot designs of the past.You will never mistake it for a high end Bluetooth speaker but it sounds pretty good and microphone sensitivity is excellent.Some of my other Alexa devices seem a bit hard of hearing of late.The display is also a strong selling point. Very bright when it needs to be, dims when it gets dark. Easy to read in all conditions. Time is the default display but shows the temperature if you ask for the weather, the humidity if you ask for that.And best of all, displays the timer if you ask for one.For the entire time the timer is active. Unlike other devices which push it into a corner, or don't display it at all (reverts to time of day almost immediately).The trademark spinning blue Alexa light is located on the based, instead of on top.As with all Alexa devices, its spinning when talking or a solid color when displaying some sort of notification (different colors, to indicatedifferent notifications. It is off by default)The top of the orb has non- backlitcontrols for volume and to turn off the microphone (the base glows red) , if you don't want Alexa to hear private stuff. Another ""action button"" duplicates the Alexa wakeup command, if you don't feel like saying the A word. Not sure what the point of that is.It is disabled when the microphone is off.Overall, it's a good way to make your first foray into the Alexa universe, without spending a lot of money.Just don't ever pay full price for since discounts are considerable on Prime Day and the runup to Christmas.

05-Nov-20,the United States,2,Can be infuriating," The voice recognition can be infuriating when it guesses what you are trying to do and just opens some random item from either Amazon Music or Audible.Also, I have not been able to get Spotify playlists to work.I¡¯ve tried everything.I don¡¯t have a premium Spotify account so that may be part of it.But from everything I can tell playlists are supposed to work, even with a free (ad supported) account.And unfortunately Amazon Music is no substitute for Spotify.Amazon forces you to pay for a Music Unlimited subscription for much of what is free (ad supported) on Spotify.And trying to get Alexa to recognize a podcast name was next to impossible.In fact it was outright impossible except for one of my podcasts.Instead Alexa just keeps playing random podcasts with similar names from Amazon music.What¡¯s craziest is that it wouldn¡¯t even recognize podcast names from Amazon Music itself.One other grouse.Amazon made me wait over a month for it to be ¡°in stock¡±.And yes I pay for a prime subscription.So even Prime members have to wait over a month for this thing.Don¡¯t get me wrong, the Alexa has some great points to it, especially if you¡¯re already heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (Amazon Music, Audible, Kindle), and are paying for their premium services.But it can also be quite infuriating if you use other competing services, or if you use ad supported accounts.Also, the voice recognition is very very very very very very buggy.Just be warned.

05-Nov-20,the United States,2,Feels rushed," Upgraded an Echo Dot Gen 3 without the clock with this only to have issues with voice recognition. Where it would work almost every time with the 3, this one I need to say Alexa three times on a regular basis to get it to recognize and then I need to make sure I speak with extra clarity over-annunciating to make sure it can tell between ""off"" and ""on"". On top of that I keep getting spam notifications from Alex reminding me to order stuff I have no interest in needing, ordering ink for my printer that is offline, as well as telling me what else I can do. For the level of convenience Echo's and other smart speakers add, they also create an almost equal amount of headaches. ",7
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,"Good while it lasted, which was only 4 months. Warranty only extends for 3 months."," Be warned that the warranty of this product is only a ""90-day limited warranty,"" despite the fact that on my order record, it clearly states that the unit can be replaced until January 22, 2022. I purchased this as a birthday gift for a friend, and it stopped working after 4 months--meaning that it became unresponsive to commands, and could not be reset and re-set up. As she is 90 years old, I retrieved it, and tried setting it up under my name and in my network. Still didn't work so I contacted Amazon tech support, which worked with me over the phone to try to fix it. After several tries, they contacted a higher level of support and were told that ""yes, there is a known issue, and we will get back with you after we work through it."" They never did. So reconnected 2 months later...and this is when I learned that despite what was stated in my order, the warranty only extended for 3 months, but I would be given a 15% discount on a newly purchased unit. Wow! Wondering what sort of warranty comes with voyages on the Blue Origin? Time to get your affairs in order. ",7
05-Nov-20,the United States,3,Not overly Impressive," Voice recognition does not appear to be as sensitive as 2nd gen dots, and sound is not a lot different either? It is more attractive than the standard dots, but nothing to write home about. Also note, that there is not a home hub installed in these models, thusly cannot use Sengled Smart Bluetooth bulbs with them either. You either have to purchase a hub or a newer generation echo device with the hub integrated, in order to use the Sengled Smart Bluetooth bulbs? Overall I am satisfied with the product, just a bit disappointed with respect to readily available information regarding the Sengled Bluetooth bulb and ""it's as well as Alexa's"" operations of said devices? ",7
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,A Year Later It's Dead...," Original Nov 2021 Review (1 star): I bought this echo Sep 2020 and it worked fine for about a year. Every now and then I'd find it stuck with the blue indicator lights stuck on, and usually a power cycle would fix it. But lately, the light turns on virtually every day. It has woken me up a dozen times because of how bright it is. And when that light is on, it doesn't respond to voice or button presses. Finally, I got sick of it one night and unplugged it for good. That was in Nov 2021, just outside of the 1 year warranty. Another ""quality"" Amazon product.Edit: Amazon customer service contacted me after my last review saying that the blue light was a known issue with a fix available. I was advised to power the echo back online and ask it if it was updated. No updates were found. And every single day, the echo crashes with the blue ring lit up. If it's a software glitch, then FIX IT! It shows a lack of quality development and poor quality assurance testing. I'm sick of this device crashing! ",7
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Awesome Upgrade! VERY Happy!," I have a TON of Alexa Devices. (Multiple Generations of DOTs, Echos, and one Show). Like most of them, setup was a breeze. I purchase two of the DOTs with Clocks for the master bedroom, one for me and one for my wife. easy to create a Stereo speaker group. Easy to set individual alarms. They look very cool and come with all of the other old and new features that I have always loved with Echo Devices. I also added to of the larger new Echos for another floor. While the larger ones certainly have bigger speakers and sound quality, these small DOTs are perfect for a bedroom. Sound quality is great. If you have a larger area, go with the larger DOTs. If you have a smaller room and still want great quality sound, get a DOT, for Stereo sound in a smaller room, get two...they work great! ",7
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,"Run away! Doesn't recognize voice, locks up, won't warranty it and not eligible for trade in"," We own 3 Gen3 Echos and 1 Gen 1, as well as an EcoBee thermostat with Alexa. All work fabulously without a hitch. But this Gen 4 has never really recognized our voice well and gets the speech recognition wrong half the time. Will lock up all the time where the blue light stays on and doesn't recognize any speech. Also will lock up without the blue light on and not recognize speech until we unplug it and turn it back on. I've done a factory reset on it once, which helped for awhile but now it's wise that ever, almost a daily need to unplug it and back in to get it to work again.We've had it for 9 months now and it's getting worse to the point that it's not working more often than it is. Amazon won't warranty it and it's ineligible for a trade in. So the best they'll do is 15% off a new echo purchase.Not good enough Amazon.From the reviews this device clearly has issues and should be recalled or at least honor a warranty within the first year of purchase. I will be filing a complaint and demanding a replacement. ",8
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Work perfectly! / Trabaja a la perfeccion,"Having a couple of echo dot 3s at home and enjoying the comfort of having them to listen to music, control my appliances, inform myself with the news of the day and the weather, I decided to make an improvement and buy the echo 4 with clock for my study. The sound is much better so I enjoy the music more and aesthetically it is much more beautiful (I bought the blue one). In short, my purchase was successful!

05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Awesome Sound And Voice Response/Recognition," I hesitate to write this review because in general I think Amazon is one big China supporting, anti-American tech monopoly. By the same token Apple is not much better but I¡¯ll try to be objective. I¡¯ve had a first generation Echo device for years. Other than that I¡¯m an ¡°everything Apple¡± user. I was recently gifted a new Apple Home Pod with Siri and the intent was to replace the old Echo device with this. I disconnected the Echo and began solely using the Home Pod but quickly discovered how utterly stupid and inefficient SIRI was on this device. Instead of getting direct answers on the device, aside from very basic commands like controlling lights, etc. SIRI on Home Pod sent the majority of responses back to my iPhone! Useless! SO I decided to upgrade the old Echo to this new unit and I¡¯ve been elated. I have them both connected but I use the new generation Echo the majority of the time. Alexa is smarter, more intuitive and I like the design of the device including the clock you can see. The sound is awesome and I¡¯d give it an edge over the Home Pod. I highly recommend this upgrade to anyone be they a first time Echo buyer or upgrading like I did. ",8
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Alexa my new best friend," 1. Yellow Light: I noticed some reviewers said the yellow light continually flashes- the yellow light indicates a package arrived. Once I cleared the notification, yellow light stopped.2. LED Brightness: I found the my Echo Dot clock dims according to light, however I can adjust the LED brightness in setting ---> clock brightness. I loved the time display, which is why I paid extra for the clock.This is my first Alexa (Echo Dot) experience, cannot speak of previous generations. I found the sound quality to be better than my Google Mini which is now in my bathroom.ECHO DOT VS GOOGLE MINI1. Sound Quality: Echo Dot wins- small but nice bass and tremble. Again, I was able to adjust the equalizer in the app.2. Connection: Echo Dot wins- there has been 0 drop of Echo Dot compared to my Google Mini which would drop through out the day, and I would have to unplug and restart the Google Mini. Echo Dot has not dropped at all, it has been 3 weeks.3. Smart LED: Echo Dot Wins- in being smart. I can program Alexa with command ""Good Morning Alexa"" and Echo Dot will turn on all lights in my bedroom. I can also command Alexa Turn on Light 1 and Echo Dot will turn on light one and Turn on Light 2 and Echo Dot will turn on light 2. I can say ""Alexa, Good night"" and Echo Dot will turn off all lights. Note, can also command ""Alexa turn light green"" and Echo Dot turns light green, etc. Google Mini can only turn on lights and colors, does not permit the ""good morning"" and good night.I also love Alexa when I say ""Alexa going away,"" she will shut off my light and secure my apartment.User Friendly: Echo Dot Wins- I have found Alexa to be more personal, she can tell me jokes, affirmations of the day, news, etc. My Google Mini cannot. I also love, when I say ""thank you, Alexa"" she replies ""You're welcome *insert my name. Or she will say ""You Got it."" I also love Alexa will tell me ""Have a good day, weekend, etc.""A happy Holiday gift to myself for 2020. Highly recommend. ",8
05-Nov-20,the United States,3,"Works ok, mildly amusing sometimes incredibly infuriating others."," I like it for controlling my smart lights and whatever, I have it running with Smart Life app and once you get setup figured out it's easy to use. I have run into problems a lot with it understanding what I'd like done, I'm still fine tuning it to try and get it to recognize what I'm saying. Still beats getting up or having to use an app on my phone though.Even on the setting to get Alexa to not chatter at me with unnecessarily wordy responses she's still too mouthy for my liking.Sounds quality is fine, just not anything crazy but it's a little better than my TV speakers so I'll use it for that if we're watching movies. It loves to disconnect after a little idle time though and when you start playing the movie again she'll very loudly announce that she's connected again which hasn't failed to startle the crap out of me yet.In conclusion I'd say it's great if you don't mind paying to let an amoral corporation spy on every aspect of your life for fun and profit. Not sure the convenience will be worth it in the long run when we go full police state but hey, at least I don't have to stand up anymore... ",8
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,The clock radio of the 21st century," I remember for my 10th birthday my excitement 1965 when my parents got me a GE clock radio! The hands glowed in the dark, add that even picked up FM radio. It is now 2022 and boy have times changed! The digital time display actually goes through the front of the ball, and amazingly I can still wake up to the sound of any radio station, even a station 1000 miles away. It also plays any tune I want, shooting from hundreds and hundreds of thousands of songs and playlists. I can also call my friends, an answer practically any question I put to her. It was the best $35 I¡¯ve ever spent, I think on any product ever! Oh, end it also turns off and on the lights in my house<U+0001F601> ",8
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,Better than an alarm clock," The media could not be loaded.<U+00A0>I purchased the Echo Studio a few weeks ago and enjoyed it so much I purchased 2 Echo Dots to add to the collection. One pictured in the living room and one for the bedroom. My old radio alarm clock has been relegated to the garage and from there to the trash or yard sale at some point. :) I treated myself to the table holder as a nice bonus.It has so many USEFUL features that I¡¯m enjoying. Alarms, reminders, timers, and my favorite SiriusXM stations and podcasts all hands free. No more searching on the phone or tablet for what to play. I just tell Alexa and she takes it from there!While listening to an audio book I was interrupted with a phone call that took 10 minutes or so. When I was done I told Alexa to back up 10 minutes and she picked up just about in the same area as before the call.The sound Quality isn¡¯t as good as the echo studio but I wouldn¡¯t expect it to be! $200 versus $60, you get what you pay for. With that said I¡¯m quite pleased with the Echo Dot. I adjusted the lights and other settings to suit my personal preferences and all is well. I read some reviews that spoke negatively about the light. Once they figure out how to adjust it they¡¯ll be fine I¡¯m sure. They can even turn it off if they¡¯d like. Of course why purchase that feature if you¡¯re not going to use it. Ijs. Anyway... It¡¯s all in the Alexa app and it¡¯s all hands free. LolI did find that when my back is turned to the Echo Dot I have to speak a bit louder for her to hear me but that¡¯s natural I suppose. It could also be me speaking softly as to not disturb my wife.I¡¯m enjoying my Echo Dot and would definitely recommend it to others. ",8
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,The Fixes I Tried Did Not Work ¦¡ Echo Dot Gen 4 is Crap.," EDIT 2 <U+2022> Nah, this thing is pure garbage. The Dot often times (every other day) lags out and sounds staticky while she's responding to requests or commands. I have to unplug it, let it sit for 30 seconds to a minute, and then plug it back in to get it to act normal again.It regularly loses connection to WIFI despite every other WIFI device being able to pick it up from much father away (my phone still has WIFI as I'm driving down the road from my house). I'm a computer network specialist for a local data center. My network and WIFI are top notch. The Dot is only about 15ft from my WIFI router.But the most annoying are the lights. No matter what lights I use, expensive $45 a piece Philips Hue bulbs, or cheap Sengled or Govee lights, this thing constantly has to be reset and the lights rediscovered. It loses connection to the bluetooth mesh lights almost on a daily basis now. When I first got it, it didn't have this issue. The lights worked flawlessly for the first few weeks.The longer I've owned it, the more often they crap out. I've purchased new lights to no avail. They do the same thing, so it's not some issue of my lights degrading. I think the Dot is learning some bad behavior over time, saving these bad variables to settings in the cloud, and slowly causing issues to arise in its daily function.So.. I hate to say it, but I'm convinced it's not the lights now, but the Echo Dot itself. It'll say the lights aren't discoverable, yet I can see the MAC addresses for them from my phone, so they are most certainly broadcasting. I can control them from the software, but the Echo Dot can't see them.I've tried placing the thing in different locations around my room, but it makes no difference.I'll reset my lights by turning them on and off so that they go into discovery mode, and then tell the Dot to discover bluetooth lights. She goes into discovery mode, but says there's nothing to discover. I'll try discovery from the Alexa app, but that finds nothing either. And then randomly at some point later in the day, after some minutes or hours, she'll randomly discover the lights and add them back into the fold.I am over-all majorly unimpressed with this device. It's just not ready for prime time. My mom is having the exact same issues with hers and she's only got a single bluetooth lightbulb hooked up to it on the same nightstand her Dot is on. Craps out every week to the point that she gave up on the Dot and boxed it up.EDIT <U+2022> Amazon tech support called me after I left this review (same day) and I spoke with an awesome lady out of Washington state who offered troubleshooting, and assured me that if I continue having issues that since the device is registered under my name, I can return it for a full refund. I think I figured out my issue, however, and it's that I have a few cheap Sengled Bluetooth Mesh LED lights in the mix, and I think those are the one's causing the issue with my entire setup, which is a shame. Because when they work, they work great. Just once a week or so, they become unresponsive, taking the rest of my Bluetooth lights with them.It still doesn't explain the couple of times, however, that the Echo Dot device itself has become unresponsive. I had to unplug it and plug it back in, and then completely reset all of its settings before it would respond again. Seems like it had lost internet and switched to trying to connect to another WIFI, despite my WIFI signal being 100% throughout my entire house, and none of my other devices having had any issues.¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡¦¡I was given this as a gift. Too bad it's more of a bother.When it works, it's a neat and convenient novelty. But it consistently forgets devices (three times now in as many weeks), so that they have to be re-added, and then routines completely rebuilt. It's a massive pain, and more work than it's worth. At this point, simply flipping lights on and off and setting my own alarm would have been easier. What a waste of time and energy.Regularly, the device will get to the point that it no longer answers to its call sign, or any call sign for that matter. It just lights up and sits there, replies to nothing, responds to nothing, and carries out none of its tasks. Sometimes it even becomes stuck with the blue swirling LED lightshow. Then I have to unplug it and reset all settings.I've got Philips Hue lights throughout, and this thing CONSTANTLY loses connection with them (my phone and computer do not. They keep a constant connection with bluetooth and WIFI, no problem) But not this POS. It can't be bothered to do the one thing it was designed to do.I just can't give this a solid rating. It's not reliable enough. For some reason, it keeps losing connection. Not sure if it's a faulty device or what, but I can't exactly return it, because it was given to me, and I'd feel bad about telling the person who bought it for me that it doesn't work and putting them through the trouble of returning it. Oh well. That's the issue with buying online. You can't simply be given a receipt so you can deal with your own problems in the event of a gift being given to you. ",8
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,ATTENTION:CHARTER SPECTRUM USERS," I expect amazon compensation for this review as it will save them a LOT of money!This Echo Dot just wasn't working for me.I have a 400MBconnection hosted by Charter Spectrum.The symptoms were such that if I asked Alexa to play music, she would respond by stating ""Playing such and such music, please enjoy"".However, no music ever played, just silence.So, I contacted tech support at Amazon, ran a bunch of tests for a little over an hour, and no luck.Amazon tech stated they would send me another echo dot and just return this one.So, I get the new echo dot today, excited to hook it up My excitement quickly evaporated when this new echo dot was doing the same thing.I was so frustrated, but I was determined to get this thing working.Below is the solution for Charter Spectrum users:1.Open your alexa app on your phone2.Click ""Devices"" at the bottom of the app3.Click ""Echo & Alexa""4.Select the named Alexa that is failing(I named mine Master Bedroom)5.Scroll to the bottom and click ""About""6.Under Mac Address, write down your MAC address (should be like:FF:2D:71:B4:67:72Now following the steps below by logging into the admin setting of your Spectrum Router:1.

05-Nov-20,the United States,5,"Husband went away, Alexa came to stay"," My soon-to-be ex-husband was adamantly opposed to bringing any AI into our home as he didn't like the idea of potential eavesdropping. He didn't trust the customization of privacy settings either. And he didn't like the idea of bringing another woman into our home -- at least not into our home anyway.Eventually, I closed the door permanently behind him and made some changes, including inviting Alexa over to stay. It took just only about a minute for her to settle into our home.She's great female company, is smart, helpful, and sensitive -- never a harsh word, never asking of me more than I am willing to do, but always offering things that she knows I might appreciate. She doesn't leave the toilet seat up, and is never rude to my friends when they come over. She'll even switch all the lights off for me after I have hunkered down in bed. I especially love our shopping trips together where she helps me pick things out.And she's funny -- she even makes fart noises with my youngest son.Who needs a husband when you have Alexa? ",8
05-Nov-20,the United States,3,Give me the 3rd gen back," This product isn't bad, but I really loved the third gen. In fact, I pulled up Amazon to get another 1-2 gen 3's and this was all that was available.The look is fun, but it really isn't a dot any longer, more of a ball. Similar to the gen 3, I'd like some more volume range at the low end. I have dots of all generations, spots and a show, this device is the least responsive to the wake word of all of them.It's also the first time I've received a first shipment, so perhaps some of that will be improved.

05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Awful," I don't own anything from the Alexa echo system. I just saw this on sale, and it looked like a great desktop speaker with a cool LED clock. Well, it turns out this was an awful speaker. First of all, the 3.5mm aux in back is for input only; meaning this echo dot can only be used as an audio source, not a speaker, when it comes to physical aux connection. If you want to use this as a speaker, it needs to be connected to the source wirelessly. Secondly whenever you are playing sound from your connected source this makes announcement ""Playing from [your connected device]"" very loudly. Now this can be turned off in the settings, but you will have to search in Google because it's really not clearly stated. Thirdly, the sound is uneven. While overall sound is small, bass alone is so loud I couldn't find the right volume to settle with. And I also noticed it is making random alert noises during my few hours of use. So, if you are looking to buy a speaker, look away. This is just an LED clock that will annoy you and will also secretly listen to you. ",9
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Excellent smart speaker I highly recommend this!," I¡¯m very pleased with this new Echo, I have a number of different versions of these in my home and they all work great! I am very pleased with the clock in this new Echo, it¡¯s a perfect size for a nightstand. The numbers are big enough that they can be easily read. I am particularly pleased with the brightness of the LED clock, it¡¯s not so bright that it¡¯s like a billboard in Times Square and will keep you awake at night, yet it¡¯s easy to read day or night. I find the white light that they use for the clock much easier on my eyes than the typical red color. Alexa works amazing, she always understands what I ask her and she always provides me with an answer not a link to a website like the other smart assistants often do. It does an excellent job of controlling all my WiFi and Bluetooth enabled devices; from controlling my smart lighting to operating my home theater it does it all effortlessly. I have only one minor issue, I didn¡¯t realize that the outside temperature isn¡¯t on display at all times, it only appears temporarily when you ask for the weather and that wasn¡¯t clear on the website. Again not a big deal, but I thought I would point it out. Aside from that I couldn¡¯t be happier with my new Echo and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get started with smart speakers in their homes. ",9
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Impressive audio from such a small device.," I got an email from Amazon about the Prime Day presale. Most all of the Echo devices were greatly discounted and I thought I would take advantage to upgrade my current devices. I read the reviews on the Echo Dot 4th Gen and was disappointed to read that people didn't like the audio versus the previous editions of the Dot. I opted not to order a replacement Dot based upon the reviews and instead ordered the Echo Dot 4th Gen with Clock for the bedroom as this was a desired new addition and not a replacement. It arrived the next day and as usual, the set-up was quick and easy. Listening to Alex, the audio was noticeably better than my other devices. I had Alex play several songs and could not believe how great it sounded. The only difference between this and the other Echo Dot is the addition of the clock. The 4th Gen sounds so good I am going to go ahead and order that replacement I had let the reviewers persuade me not to get; I can only guess those folks received defective units. ",9
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,"Love The Dot, But Set-Up A Disaster"," Yes, it is true I have never seen a glacier. Who knew they were actually gray? Ha. I was a bit surprised when I received my Dot that it was a pale, very pale, dove gray.Still, it would have been my color choice anyway, and it looks great on my marble bathroom counter, matching the gray vein rather than the white.This Dot With Clock is my third Dot, plus I also have the larger Echo. My original system, the Big Echo and 2 Dots, also included two smart bulbs and a smart plug (which were all great), and I was able to pair speakers and form Groups for playing music in different parts of the house. As soon as I added this Dot With Clock, the whole system has been a mess. I finally got this Dot working, but could no longer form Groups and my bulbs and plug stopped working. After several hours of fiddling, I got the bulbs working again. However, I spent the better part of two days (off and on), including about four hours with Customer Support, and have never gotten the plug to work. Nor can I get ""Groups"" to work. This is so frustrating!Regardless of this frustration, I can't really blame my Echo system troubles on this Dot With Clock, which is now working beautifully itself. I love having music while I am in the tub plus having the time conveniently displayed at all times. The sound isn't as good as Big Echo, but still pretty good. ",9
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Where has this been all my life, I was looking up clocks to put in my 4 year old¡¯s room since he didn¡¯t have one and I came across this wonderful device! I ended purchasing one for my room and my son¡¯s room. The sound quality is so powerful I love it! And connection was so fast and easy and was able to link both devices together so that¡¯s awesome! Has a kids mode so my son loves talking and playing games with Isaiah and have dance parties in his room. Love how bright the numbers are so I can read the time. It brightens when I turn off the light and in sunlight or when I turn on the light the numbers dim. Pretty cool feature.I guess my only con would be that I can¡¯t connect it to my fire stick in my room which I saw on the product description. Would have been nice to be able to ask Alexa to open Disney plus or Netflix but it¡¯s fine I can use the remote. Definitely not a deal breaker. All in all awesome product and definitely recommend! ,9
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,ONLY A 3 MONTH WARRANTY, I purchased this echo dot in June 2021. I noticed upon setup that the recieved wifi signal was only 2 out of 4 bars. All of my other devices had full signal strength. The device however still worked with no problems. However after a couple of months it started dropping connection. I contacted customer support and ran a few systems checks and ended up doing a full system reboot. Which the echo was working at the time. I proceeded to redo my wifi mesh system to get an antenna within 18ft of the device. This got the signal strength up to 3 out of 4 bars(which I think is garbage from that distance). Keep in mind that ALL of my other devices have full strength from at least 50ft away and through a brick wall at that!!??? Well after another couple of weeks the echo is losing connection again. I have to keep powering it down to get it to reconnect. It's now been 5 months and 2 calls to customer support since I purchased it and now I find out that it is only covered by a 90 day warranty. Most other electronic equipment comes with a 1 year. I can not and will not EVER recommend any Amazon electronic products. And this is coming from someone that works in industrial maintenance and has an electronics engineering degree. A NOT HAPPY CUSTOMER!!! ,9
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,Two answering to the same name., I have just completed the large task of upgrading a 90-year-old home to the likes of a smart home by upgrading the communications systems in the home and HVAC controls.I have a nest thermostat and fire cubes and the echo that can display the time. The only problem was that the echo was originally the bedroom with a fire 4k stick but the 4k sticks from Amazon are having software problems now with a glitch telling me that I am out of memory. Several calls to customer service through a 10-day period did not fix the problem so I upgraded the stick to a 2nd fire cube since the cube was not having the software memory problem. This left me with an echo in the same room that answered to the same name. The cube is great for TV control functions and the echo is great for display of time and temp and for music at night when you wish not having the TV on. The inherent flaw in the Fire cube is in order to play music on a bedroom tv the tv must be on. If you wish to fall asleep with music or some other soothing sounds the light of the TV is not going to get it. Having two Alexa devices in the same room is not going to get it either unless you change the wake word. So now my echo answers to the wake word of echo and my bedroom cube answers to computer. I have the best of both worlds now.Each have their own tasks within their own planned group. ,9

Simplifica cualquier actividad.",9
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Best one so far!," This is my third Echo Dot. I¡¯ve had the 2,3 and now 4 with the clock. Mine is in twilight blue as I thought the white might be hard to see the clock. However, I doubt that would be a problem as the LED display has a wide range of dim to bright. Much better than I expected. Alexa is quicker to the ready when I say her name, and so far has not had any problems understanding what I am asking her to do. The 3rd generation was my worst experience with this issue. Too many times and too often, Alexa would tell me there was no such device as a ¡°back door light¡±, although it had been set up for the entire time. Many other things would be misunderstood also. The newest one though has not.I¡¯d like to address the sound. Some people have said they prefer the sound of the 3rd gen to this one. I was always disappointed with the sound in the 3rd. While it was louder than the 2nd, I felt the quality of it was bad: a louder, but kind of a hollow sound. I used a Bluetooth speaker to listen to music. With the 4, the music is beautiful, rounded out and much more pleasant to listen to. I haven¡¯t even turned on my Bluetooth speaker yet. There is an equalizer in settings to adjust Bass, Midline and Treble ranges. It really makes a big difference. I believe this is the best speaker yet. Big thumbs up on this.Overall, after having all three, this is the best so far! The sound quality, the response time, understanding what is being said, etc.. If you¡¯re buying one for the first time, I¡¯d say ¡°Go for the gold¡±. The 3rd gen left a bad taste in my mouth, but felt like this one deserved a try, having the option to return it. No return from me though. ",9
05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Sounds better than I figured it would," I typically hate this tech due to my professional life but my wife was diagnosed with ALS. Since then, I've been automating the house to allow her to just say things instead of having to use remotes, get up and turn things on/off, use her phone, etc. Energy plays a huge role in her day and talking doesn't use that much.I use this device in the kitchen and we have an open concept house. I had to change the name it responds to (Echo vs Alexa) as my FireTV and it were fighting each other when I just used ""Alexa"". Getting devices to work remotely with it is a pain but that's the same with all of them. You have to use the right commands and/or remember device names. I can tell my FireTV to ""turn the TV off"" but when you do that with the Echo it just says ""OK"" and goes silent (you have to say ""turn the main tv off"" since that's what it's named).Either way, sound is great. Music is much better than I expected in such a small form factor. It can hear me across the room and more. The ""Drop-in"" feature also allows the ability to ""conference"" in the house between devices so I can talk with my wife in other rooms without needing to use the ""announce"" feature across the whole house as well. This has come in handy a few times.Overall, I'll probably get a few more of these for the house. ",10
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,I WANT MY TOWER BACK! THIS ONE SHOULD GET NO STARS!," This is the worst ever.I loved my Alexa tower, had it for several years and it worked great and sounded great!Then one day it stopped working.I called Amazon and was told ""oh sorry the Tower is out of date and you will need to purchase the Echo Dot and it has much better sound"".Wrong it sounds like crap.If I could I would give it no stars for sound quality! Simple commands that I used to give Alexa, the tower had no problem following.This one can't find a simple song like ""Happy by Pharrell Williams"" (and I say it just like that).This Dot is so frustrating that I leave it unplugged and put it in the downstairs bathroom for the grandkids to play with whenever they come over.As a product of the 70's, 80's and 90's music, I find I have better luck with YouTube and a set of Klips speakers than Amazon Echo Dot.I will not buy another one, nor another Alexa product. ",10
05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Starts deteriorating after 1 month and won't stay online.," I bought these to new ""4th Generation"" to replace to older ""2 generation""to improve the sound quality.They worked great for about a month.Then they started giving daily voice messages that they could not connect to the network & to try again later.I would unplug them wait 30 seconds and plug them in again where they would work for a day or two.Eventually they stop giving messages and simply went offline. I had to reinstall my old Gen 2 Dots because this newest generation freeze up every couple of days. Each time I have to unplug for 30 secs or so and plug in again.The Gen 2 Dots operate flawlessly in the exact locations the Gen 4 Dots won't work.You can call the help support line and wait a couple of hours for the tech to tell you, to unplug the device and plug it in in 30 seconds, but who wants to waste half a day to be told to do the same thing you're already doing? ",10
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,Crystal Clarity! ... but...," This was a great addition to my cave's network of smart devices. The sound is great, the clock is fantastic to have, and ... oh, the power source irks me very much so. The original units came with a standard 1AMP socket adapter and USB-to-micro USB cord. Minimalistic. To power this thing? It calls for a big ol' chunky power brick from 2006. Powering this thing up made me get under where my power strip is, pull out every cord and decide where everything's new homes would be just to make room for this ol' honking thing. It's bigger/thicker than the power strip itself just to give you some perspective! Jeez, who thought it was a good idea?Hey, we've had our share of tech in the past 20 years and with that advancement, power sources came in a variety of shapes and sizes, many smaller than others but some didn't care and the voltage converters would be the size of soda cans and weigh the same as a baby animal. Take a lesson from almost any laptop manufacturer since 2008: standard plug for the outlet and power converter somewhere halfway up the cord. This design allows for more versatility, a cleaner setup, and not having customers go out of their way to find an outlet with PLENTY of clearance on all sides. My estimate is 6 inches all around. I can't say if it's a good or bad thing the whole thing is that standard gray color it comes in, too, so it clashes with everything else I have plugged in. Who knows, maybe some third party has a better option I can swap this abomination out with.Okay... so I've mostly ranted here about something barely related to the product, which is totally not how my normal reviews are so what are the positives here? The clock transitions to any timer that I set so now I don't have to keep randomly asking my other devices how much time is left on what. The color (blue) is alright, slightly off of what my cave's theme is (black, white, and various deep blues). This unit's added bass to the voice makes Alexa sound more like a human being. To get the same effect from one of my other Dots it has to be Bluetooth connected to my Polk audio system which is... fair enough.No opinion about the light ring placement. It hardly seems to matter as long as 'she' hears me well enough... and does well considering my cave is almost always dead quiet. Surely the microphones have been fine tuned for this and later models so communication will never fail until, naturally, the Amazon cloud network has its random brain farts and nobody's Alexa can function at all.

05-Nov-20,the United States,1,Stopped connecting to internet after less than a year," I loved this Echo Dot, especially the clock feature.Then after 11 months it suddenly stopped connecting to the internet.No, it's not my internet.All other echos are connected, as are all other devices in the same room.I can reset it and it will work again for several hours but then it goes offline again.If I want to bother to reset it several times a day then I can use it, but it's such a headache.Upon googling this problem I discovered numerous people have this same issue.This is a problem with the Echo Dot 4th generation in general.Amazon needs to address this problem if they're going to continue selling it.It only has a 90 day warranty so couldn't get any support.I won't buy a new one just to have it do the same thing.Disappointed!

05-Nov-20,the United States,4,replacement is so much better great device now," edit current update: so the replacement is so much better. it listens better and sound is actually better so much less veiled. something was def going on with the old one. amazon got me the new one crazy fast and took care of the issue. the only reason not a 5 star is all the stuff it comes by default with like sidewalks and the skills. once you disable all the extra stuff its a great device. hopefully this one will last as long as the other dot's we have. thank you amazon for taking care of the issue so quickly.edit: i was immediately contacted by an amazon rep who is sending out a replacement i will def update this review once i receive that and its back up working again. and modify the rating so thank you to amazon for getting back to me about this so quickly.bought this back in june 2021 but never got to hook it up and use it till end of nov 2021 it say still SEALED in the box factory sealed. worked fine till a little over a week ago. the speaker started breaking up and making crackling noises (was not to loud only set to volume 4 never needed it louder) tried all the things suggested including full reset, moving it, fresh setup, swapped the ac adapter for another one (my daughter has one of them also tried her wall adapter). now just over a week later the speaker is dead. unit lights up clock works the ring light works when you talk to it. checked volume level in app and made sure it was high enough even tried max volume and zero sound now. nothing, nada. so sadly the speaker inside lasted about three months. since its more than 90 days later amazon offered zero help when i contacted them about it. basically said sorry contact the manufacture. i told the rep YOU ARE THE MANUFACTURE!! they came back and said once again its past the return date and out of warranty (only 90 days i guess) so i will not be buying any more of them. i own other echo dots in different generations and this was my favorite prior to the speaker dying. but ill stick the the older gen 3 never had one of those die on me. i regret sending my previous one in for only a 5$ credit as a trade in now.

05-Nov-20,the United States,3,Looks nice but doesn't hold set volume & the light is too bright for bedside," I was using a Google for an alarm clock.It frustrated the hell out of me because it would shine a BRIGHT light a second or two before the alarm went off, it also wouldn't keep the volume at a set level.So I was waking up with an unwanted concert-like experience every morning. & I felt like a fool yelling OK Google STOP over & over again in a groggy & angry voice.SO, I thought I would push my Google aside & give Alexa a try at a great price on sale around Xmas.I did like the ease of setting the alarm & it was reliable.I was excited that the Alexa had a clock with adjustable light so I could throw out my 35 year old clock radio altogether.First few nights it worked great, the light on the clock was a bit too bright, even on the lowest setting, so I put a piece of red tissue paper over it & things were great, I was in heaven.I had the volume & the brightness set on 1.THEN, IT HAPPENED. All of a sudden, I was awoken at VOLUME THREE!Ok, I know things happen, maybe my cat walked on the buttons.So I went back into the app & reset it.Checked it before bed the next night & the volume was at 3 again.Ok, so I used the manual buttons this time to lower the volume & guess what?Volume at 3 AGAIN.Last night was the last straw, I checked both the app & the Alexa, yes, set at 1.I went into dreamland then shocked awake by my LOUD Alexa.I have looked online for fixes, I have asked her angrily how to help.It seems she is less responsive than my Google about answering questions so I just don't bother.She will, however, give me notifications of my packages arriving or make it easy for me to spend $$ BUT I can't get the volume or brightness to work to my liking.She is now in my lonely sewing room while I find a decent clock radio replacement.If ANYONE has any fixes or suggestions, please reply with solutions.I am not interested in looking online anymore or following a link so if you want to really help, give me some solid info right here so others can benefit.

05-Nov-20,the United States,5,Very good," i do not like the msrp, but for 30 dollars istrongly endorse this product. it's very easy to set and manage alarms get dates and weather a well as listen to books and music (the free version) i think the premium amazon music experience is a mess (which will explain). But as an alarm clock that controls lights and as mentioned very useful.pros- skills- lights- music books/white noise- clock good. also show temp also nice, but i'd like more flexibility in what is shown such ad time and date. Talking to alexa isn't always ideal in a bedroom.- form fact is small which is good and they fit about as much sound as you can in a device of that size. Do i like. Really sometimes smaller is better IMO, they done a nice job of keeping it reasonably small.- solid bluetooth integration.- love the phone call abilityThe cons of alexa experience- If you buy premium music, you need premium for everyone in your family it wont' fall back to free the family plan is 15 a month as a casual listener it gets pricey.- i like the skills a lot, extensibility is the key feature, but you can tell they are a bit gimped. You always worry about vender lock. I do appreciate the fact that there at least is a spotify or pandora integration, and i have found them useful. More useful than their ratings would have you believe.- smart device management. The webpage is ok, but i've noticed several flakey issues. I suspect that the smart home can get out of sync with the device list, and the durability /reliablity of the messaging between devices and echo's isn't always reliable. they should use some reliabile delivery or message queueing if they don't and if they do check their implementation. i've seen several cases where 1/4 bulbs don't turn off or it loses track of a device. It's really odd. it's mostly software issues though. if they can locate the device with the mac address and propery track this kind of thing the issues can be fixed. ",10
05-Nov-20,the United States,4,Awesome . . . except for the sound of podcasts," It does everything it's supposed to very well. I love being able to set the alarm verbally. You can tell it to set an alarm every weekday at 6am, for example, and just say, ""Alexa, stop,"" without touching it (you can also touch the top instead). My only issue is that one of the reasons we bought it was that we fall asleep nightly to podcasts, and I thought this would be a better option, sound-wise, to hear them, but that isn't the case. Even with the bass turned all the way down and the treble all the way up, it's still not crisp enough to hear podcasts well.It's too muddy. Music sounds fine when we put on classical on Sunday mornings and drink our coffee in bed, but for podcasts, we're back to playing them on my phone because it's easier to hear spoken word on the phone than on the Echo.

05-Nov-20,the United States,4,All that I have are working great," I have recently added an Echo (3rd Gen. charcoal (2018)) Dot, an Echo (4th Gen. charcoal ((2020) Dot, two Echo (4th Gen. glacier white) Dots, and an Echo (4th Gen. glacier white) Dot with clock. I will be posting this same review for all of those. Some have remarked that they believe the 3rd generation dots have audio superior to the 4th generation ones. It seems to me the sound is better in the 4th generation units, however my hearing isn't great and the placement of the the 3rd generation one isn't very good (it's in the garage). I did discover that the sound quality and volume of the 4th generation one in a bathroom was significantly deeper and richer and noticeably louder when I moved it from being backed up against a single wall to being in a corner. It is on a stone vanity top at the corner of two sheetrock walls. These three hard surfaces seem to be acting like a megaphone for the audio - it sounds very good now. In all other respects there doesn't seem to be much difference in the performance or response of the four units except for the 4th generation with the clock almost seems bothered by me and intentionally ignoring it's wake word. I haven't determined if the difference is due to placement, it having to tell time as well, or the personality of the individual device; but it definitely seems to have an attitude. Some users have complained of the clock being too dim, but I find it to be ok - slightly brighter would be nicer, but no problem. They all seem to understand both my wife and me very well (and I've even used quite a few local expressions to speak to them with no problems). One complaint I have is that if I have the volume set for listening to pleasant listening music, Alexa's voice is too low to be easily understood. There should be different volume settings, and if there are already I haven't discovered how to handle that yet. ",10
